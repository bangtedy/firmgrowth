Firms grow by increasing their capital stock, which enhances their production capacity.\n\n- Technological Progress: Technological advancements play a crucial role in firm growth by improving productivity and efficiency. Firms that adopt new technologies can produce more output with the same amount of inputs.\n\n- Labor: The quantity and quality of labor employed by firms are important determinants of growth. Firms grow by hiring more workers or by improving the skills and productivity of their existing workforce.\n\n- Market Conditions: The overall market environment, including demand for products and services, competition, and regulatory factors, influences firm growth. Firms that operate in favorable market conditions are more likely to grow.\n\n- Managerial Efficiency: Effective management and organizational practices contribute to firm growth by optimizing resource allocation and improving decision-making processes.\n\n## Production Possibility Curve (PPC) {.smaller}\n\n![](images/ppf.png)\n\n- Growth requires increases in quantity and quality of input (K and L).\n- Growth requires conditions and specific types of resources and capabilities (firms are heterogeneous).\n- Firm growth requires flexibility to make changes in technology, workforce composition, product, location.\n\n## Criticisms of Neo-Classical Theory {.smaller}\n\nWhile neo-classical economics provides a useful framework for understanding firm growth, it has been criticized.\n\n- *The black-box* firm of equilibrium price theory with the famous MR=MC rule. \n- MC is derived from production and cost function\n- MR is derived from demand function\n- In the neo-classical scheme, what inhibits further production expansion are the increasing costs resulting from increasing the production. \n- Many managers report that in the real economy the black box is not controlled by the force of MC = MR, but by something more fundamental. Apparently it is not solely the marginal cost that makes firms to go into the standby position. \n- Real firms: enact strategies, manage the creation and acquisition of information and knowledge, and that have internal organisational structures and processes.\n\n## Neoclassical economics +\n\n- Transaction cost economics (TCE)\n- Resource base view (RBV)\n- Evolutionary Economics\n\n## What is a firm?\n\n[**A techno-functional entity**]{style=\"color:blue;\"}\n\nAs a black box that transforms factor inputs into outputs---how production and cost functions interact with demand on the market, i.e. the emphasis is on technical matters and how firms function in the context of the market.\n\n[**An institutional entity**]{style=\"color:blue;\"}\n\nIdentity, internal structure and external boundaries (Hodgson, 2002)\n\n## Quantity, quality and flexibility (K&L)\n\n- The quantity and quality of $K$ and $L$ is derived from $MRP_L$ and $MRP_K$ ... a techno-functional entity.\n- The flexibility in using $K$ and $L$ ... identity, internal structure and external boundaries...an institutional entity.\n\n## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.smaller}\n\nIf we were to point out the strongest factors determining the obstacles, there would be three interrelated ones: (1) uncertainty, (2) competition and (3) lack of path dependence in the accumulation of capital. \n\n- Uncertainty determines the inevitability of making mistakes in every action undertaken.\n\n- Competition means that there are always other entrepreneurs in markets who, in the environment of uncertainty, will succeed and fail at the same time as others do, interchangeably. \n\n- And finally, the third decisive factor: there is no guarantee that past successes improve the decision-making of firms in subsequent rounds.\n\n## The message\n\n- A central message presented in this research is that in discussing firm growth requires **both** techno-functional and institutional foundations.\n- A firm as a techno-functional entity implies an ability to hire, buy and organise factors of production and contract for the sale of output. \n- This hiring, buying, organising and contracting implies a pre-existing institutional structure covering, for instance, legal and accounting systems. \n- Firm growth is a matter of degree/gradation\n\n## The message\n\n- No universal status can be claimed for any particular theoretical perspective, i.e. a theoretical pluralism is required. \n- A key issue here is that it is a fundamentally empirical question as to which perspective is relevant and dominant in particular conditions and circumstances. \n- This empirically driven relevance opens up a significant, and open-ended, research agenda.\n\n## Growth as a matter of degree\n\n- Firm growth can be seen as gradations of membership: stagnant, slow, fast, very fast.\n- If firm growth is thought to be a matter of degree, then fuzzy set theory claims that we can \nmeaningfully address the issue of how much the sets of firm that grow and conditions (such as financially constrained, size or age of firm) intersect. \n\n## Fuzzy set\n\n- Consider that almost all social science theory is verbal and, as such, is formulated in terms of sets and set relations.\n- Researchers in the social sciences have long observed that although human beings break up their world into categories, they often use categories with blurred edges and gradations of membership. \n- This is also true of many concepts employed in the social sciences such poverty, standard of living, financial development, economic growth and firm growth.\n\n## QCA {.scrollable}\n\n- A phenomenon is studied as a combination of conditions that together produce an outcome.\n- The effect of a particular condition on outcome is never fixed, as it depends on the other condition that co-occur at that point in time.\n- The aim is to specify the causal recipe that is sufficient to explain the outcome of each case in a multiple case study.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThis thesis examines the configuration of conditions that may promote or mitigate firm growth. Firms can operate in different condition and grow or they can operate in the same condition but do not grow. \n\n<br/>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">We take up the idea that the prevailing way for firm to grow is the outcome of the configuration of sets of conditions</p>.\n\n## Research Agenda {.scrollable}\n\n- To explore the degree to which firm heterogeneity (internal factors) and business environment (external factors) explain firm growth variability. \n- To explore configurations of factors suspected to causally influence firm growth.\n- Little is known about how configurations among internal and external that foster or hinder growth.\n\n## Empirical works\n\n- **Internal**: age, profit, productivity, investment, competition, owner, ownership structure, legal status, capital intensity, management structure.\n- **External**: an unsympathetic banking community, constricting government policies, tax and regulation, infrastructure, failures of business education. \n\n## Data\n\n- Main: World Bank Enterprise Survey [WBES](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/enterprisesurveys)\n- 8 ASEAN members + Timor Leste (2009-2023)\n- Sampling stratification: firm size, location, business sector\n- Post stratification: gender of top manager, exporting status, ownership\n\n## Outputs \n\n- [perf1] Real annual sales growth (%) \n- [perf2] Annual employment growth (%) \n- [perf3] Real annual labor productivity growth (%) \n- [perf4] Percent of firms buying fixed assets \n- [t3] Capacity utilization (%)* \n\n## Conditions {.smaller}\n\n- [mgmt1] Management practices index 0-100 in from 2023\n- [t7] Percent of firms that introduced a new product/service over last 3 years \n- [t9] Percent of firms that introduced a process innovation over last 3 years \n- [t10] Percent of firms that spend on R&D in the last fiscal years \n- [wk19] Proportion of skilled workers, out of all permanent production workers\n- [gend1] Percent of firms with women participation in ownership\n- [fin23] Percent of firms that are fully credit constrained \n- [reg1] Senior management time spent in dealing with government regulation \n- [graft2] Bribery depth\n- [in11] Percent of firms identifying transportation as a major or very severe constraint \n- [hc] Percent of the population with a tertiary education, and e-skills\n- [dmd] Disposable income per capita relative to ASEAN average \n\n## Conceptual Framework\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/configur.png){fig-align='center' width=91%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Propositions {.smaller}\n\n- **Proposition 1**: Management practice condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 2**: Innovation and technology condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 3**: Workforce condition is an influential elements in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 4**: Credit constraint condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 5**: Regulation and taxes condition is an influential elements in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 6**: Corruption condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 7**: Physical infrastructure condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n\n## Operationalisation\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/operationalisation.png){fig-align='center' width=91%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Contribution {.scrollable}\n\nThis study provides insights into new ways of conceptualizing firms’ improvements in terms of making business environment right by implementing a “right-factors configuration,” a map of combinations of conditions.\n\n## Aims\n\nThe key objective of this thesis is to provide a deeper understanding of the configurations of conditions for firm growth.\n\nIn particular, this research aims to answer the following three research questions: \n\n- Does a correlation exist between a more robust financial sector and stable long-term economic growth? \n\ntranslate into equifinality, asymmetry, etc\n\n## Benefits/contribution\n\nAdding further empirical evidence to this nexus is quite essential; however, examining the factors that may erode or promote this relationship is more imperative. \n\nDiscussing such factors justifies why the results vary between countries and assists policymakers in addressing issues that might erode this substantial influence before conducting national development plans to promote the financial sector. \n\n## Contribution\n\nThis thesis builds on the literature by creating and refining a broad and up-to-date new database based on the availability of relevant data to assess the relationship between financial development and economic growth and adds further evidence regarding financial development effects on economic growth.\n\n## Limitation\n\nLike most literature, limitations in data availability exist for some variables, such as the financial sector depth and informal institution dataset. \n\nDespite these concerns, this thesis created and refined a broad and up-to-date new database based \non the availability of relevant data. \n\n## References\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \n# {background-iframe=\"grid-worms/index.html\"} \nBackground for title slide, not working in this version of Quarto -->\n```",
