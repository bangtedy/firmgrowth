Firm growth and decline is at the core of economic dynamics, provides [\"opportunity\"]{style=\"color:green;\"}, [\"prosperity\"]{style=\"color:green;\"} ... employment, output and reducing poverty ... or [\"disaster\"]{style=\"color:red;\"}.\n\n<br/>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">--- the importance of economic growth for general human well-being ---</p>\n\n## Motivation\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">To broaden the understanding of the determinants of firm growth...[recipes!]{style=\"color:red;\"}</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n## Southeast Asia {.scrollable}\n\n- Growth—and the drivers behind their growth—vary by economy and subregion.\n- The industrial landscape is dominated by small firms, which account for the bulk of output and employment\n- Significantly less productive and account for a smaller share of the productivity growth... aggregate productivity in these economies remains low.\n- Providing employment for a large proportion of less experienced and less educated workers belonging to the poorer households in urban and semi-urban areas. \n- The determinants of small firm performance in developing countries remain less understood, with much of the earlier literature focusing on the large firms. \n\n## The literature {.scrollable}\n\nThe evidence remains inconclusive!!\n\n- For large firms, studies highlight factors like trade costs, lower Research and Development (R&D) spending and macro factors such as taxation and regulation.\n- For studies on small firms in developing countries, stress firm capabilities, access to external finance, favorable location and geographical factors and robust social and physical infrastructure. \n- There are also studies which suggest that the development of the financial sector need not always be a pre-requisite for firm growth.\n\n## Thus...contextual and configural?\n\nGiven the evident lack of consensus in the existing literature, it is imperative to summarise this conflict as ...\n\n<br />\n\n[the influence of various factors on firm growth varies from one country to another depends on the context and configuration?]{style=\"color:green;\"}\n\n## Research agenda\n\nDespite the difficulty imagining a modern economy without firm, the results of the current literature on the firm growth still vary between countries, which makes this field intriguing. \n\n<br />\n\nThis variation of results prompts several questions about the conditions behind this and, most importantly, investigate the potential [\"conditions\"]{style=\"color:red;\"} that cause firm growth.\n\n## Research questions\n\n1. Which configurations of conditions are associated with firm growth?\n2. How do these configurations differ across firm contexts?\n\n## Neoclassical economics {.scrollable}\n\nNeo-classical economics provides a framework for understanding firm growth and its determinants: \n\n- **Profit Maximization**: **MR = MC** rule.\n- **Diminishing Returns**: the additional output produced from each additional unit of input will eventually decrease.\n- **Flexible Prices and Wages**: Prices and wages are adjusting to changes in supply and demand to maintain equilibrium in the market.\n- **Competitive Markets**: Firms operating in an environment close to perfect competition, where prices are determined by competitive pressures.\n\n## Determinants of firm growth {.scrollable}\n\n- **Capital Accumulation**: Investment in physical capital, such as machinery and equipment enhances their production capacity.\n- **Technological Progress**: Technological advancements improve productivity and efficiency...so that firms that adopt new technologies can produce more output with the same amount of inputs.\n- **Labor**: The quantity and quality of labor...firms grow by hiring more workers or by improving the skills and productivity of their existing workforce.\n- **Market Conditions**: The overall market environment: demand for products and services, competition, and regulatory factors... firms that operate in favorable market conditions are more likely to grow.\n- **Managerial Efficiency**: Effective management and organizational practices ... optimize resource allocation and improving decision-making processes.\n\n## Production Possibility Curve (PPC) {.smaller}\n\n![](images/ppf.png)\n\n- Growth requires increases in quantity and quality of input (K and L).\n- Growth requires conditions and specific types of resources and capabilities (firms are heterogeneous).\n- Firm growth requires flexibility to make changes in technology, workforce composition, product, location.\n\n## Criticisms of Neo-Classical Theory {.scrollable}\n\nWhile neo-classical economics provides a useful framework for understanding firm growth, it has been criticized.\n\n- The **black-box** firm of equilibrium price theory with the famous MR=MC rule. \n- In the Neo-classical scheme, what inhibits further production expansion are the increasing costs resulting from increasing the production. \n- Many managers report that in the real economy the black box is not controlled by the force of MC = MR, but by something more fundamental. Apparently it is not solely the marginal cost that makes firms to go into the standby position. \n- Real firms: enact strategies, manage the creation and acquisition of information and knowledge, and have internal organisational structures and processes.\n\n## Neoclassical economics +\n\n- Transaction cost economics (TCE)\n- Resource base view (RBV)\n- Evolutionary Economics\n\n## What is a firm?\n\n[**A techno-functional entity**]{style=\"color:green;\"}\n\nAs a black box that transforms factor inputs into outputs---how production and cost functions interact with demand on the market, i.e. the emphasis is on technical matters and how firms function in the context of the market.\n\n[**An institutional entity**]{style=\"color:green;\"}\n\nIdentity, internal structure and external boundaries (Hodgson, 2002)\n\n## Quantity, quality and flexibility (K&L)\n\n- The quantity and quality of K and L is derived from $MRP_L$ and $MRP_K$ ... a techno-functional entity.\n- The flexibility in using K and L ... identity, internal structure and external boundaries...an institutional entity.\n\n## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.smaller}\n\nIf we were to point out the strongest factors determining the obstacles, there would be three interrelated ones: (1) uncertainty, (2) competition and (3) lack of path dependence in the accumulation of capital. \n\n- Uncertainty determines the inevitability of making mistakes in every action undertaken.\n\n- Competition means that there are always other entrepreneurs in markets who, in the environment of uncertainty, will succeed and fail at the same time as others do, interchangeably. \n\n- And finally, the third decisive factor: there is no guarantee that past successes improve the decision-making of firms in subsequent rounds.\n\n## The message\n\nA central message presented in this research is that in discussing firm growth requires [both]{style=\"color:red;\"} techno-functional and institutional foundations.\n\n- A firm as a techno-functional entity implies an ability to hire, buy and organise factors of production and contract for the sale of output. \n- This hiring, buying, organising and contracting implies a pre-existing institutional structure covering, for instance, legal and accounting systems. \n\n## The message\n\nNo universal status can be claimed for any particular theoretical perspective, i.e. a theoretical [pluralism]{style=\"color:green;\"} is required. \n\n- A key issue here is that it is a fundamentally empirical question as to which perspective is relevant and dominant in particular conditions and context. \n- This empirically driven relevance opens up a significant, and open-ended, research agenda.\n\n## Fuzzy set\n\n- Researchers in the social sciences have long observed that although we break up things into categories, we often use categories with blurred edges and gradations of membership. \n- This is also true of many concepts employed in economics such as poverty, standard of living, financial inclusion, economic growth and firm growth.\n\n## Growth as a matter of degree\n\n- Firm growth can be seen as [gradations]{style=\"color:red;\"} of membership: stagnant, slow, fast, very fast.\n- If firm growth is thought to be [a matter of degree]{style=\"color:red;\"}, then fuzzy set theory claims that we can meaningfully address the issue of how much the sets of firm that grow and its conditions [(such as financially constrained, partly constrained, size, age of firm)]{style=\"color:green;\"} intersect.\n\n## QCA (Qualitative Comparative Analysis)\n\n- A phenomenon is studied as a combination of conditions that together produce an outcome.\n- The effect of a particular condition on outcome is never fixed, as it depends on the other condition that co-occur at that point in time.\n- The aim is to specify the causal [recipe]{style=\"color:red;\"} that is sufficient to explain the outcome using set theory and Boolean algebra.\n\n## Firm growth QCA perspective\n\nConsider that almost all social science theory is verbal and, as such, is formulated in terms of sets and set relations.\n\nThere are configurations of conditions that are associated with firm growth. Firms can operate in different condition and grow or they can operate in the same condition but do not grow. \n\nThe prevailing way for firm to grow is the outcome of the configuration of sets of conditions in certain context.\n\n## Previous empirical works\n\nMuch work has been done using representative and comprehensive data sets.\n\n- The growth rate of a firm as *dependent variable*, \n- Attempts were made to explain this rate in terms of a long list of other variables.\n- Firm growth is highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict\n- The growth rate distributions follow a \"tent-shaped\" pattern.\n\n## Previous empirical works\n\n- **Internal**: age, profit, productivity, investment, competition, owner, ownership structure, legal status, capital intensity, management structure.\n- **External**: an unsympathetic banking community, constricting government policies, tax and regulation, infrastructure, failures of business education. \n\n## Data\n\n- Main: World Bank Enterprise Survey [WBES](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/enterprisesurveys) +\n- ASEAN members (2009-2023)\n\n## Outputs \n\n- [perf1] Real annual sales growth (%) \n- [perf2] Annual employment growth (%) \n- [perf3] Real annual labor productivity growth (%) \n- [perf4] Percent of firms buying fixed assets \n- [t3] Capacity utilization (%)* \n\n## Conditions {.smaller}\n\n- [mgmt1] Management practices index\n- [t7] Percent of firms that introduced a new product/service over last 3 years \n- [t9] Percent of firms that introduced a process innovation over last 3 years \n- [t10] Percent of firms that spend on R&D in the last fiscal years \n- [wk19] Proportion of skilled workers, out of all permanent production workers\n- [gend1] Percent of firms with women participation in ownership\n- [fin23] Percent of firms that are fully credit constrained \n- [reg1] Senior management time spent in dealing with government regulation \n- [graft2] Bribery depth\n- [in11] Percent of firms identifying transportation as a major or very severe constraint \n- [hc] Percent of the population with a tertiary education, and e-skills\n- [dmd] Disposable income per capita relative to ASEAN average \n\n## Context\n\n<br />\n\nFirm size, location, business sector (sampling stratification)\n\n<br />\n\nGender of top manager, exporting status, ownership (post stratification)\n\n## Conceptual Framework\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/configur.png){fig-align='center' width=91%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Propositions {.smaller}\n\n- **Proposition 1**: Management practice condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 2**: Innovation and technology condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 3**: Workforce condition is an influential elements in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 4**: Credit constraint condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 5**: Regulation and taxes condition is an influential elements in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 6**: Corruption condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n- **Proposition 7**: Physical infrastructure condition is an influential element in firm growth.\n\n## Operationalisation\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/operationalisation.png){fig-align='center' width=91%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Steps\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/qca_process.png){fig-align='center' width=87%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Contribution {.scrollable}\n\nThis study provides recipes of a “right-factors configuration” ... conducive for firms’ improvements by making business environment right. \n\n<br />\n\nDiscussing such factors justifies why the results vary between countries and assists policymakers in addressing issues that might erode this substantial influence before conducting national development plans to promote private sector. \n\n## Limitation\n\n- QCA itself + QR\n- Limitations in data availability exist for some variables.  \n\n- Cross-section data\n\n- Longitudinal data\n\n## References\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \n# {background-iframe=\"grid-worms/index.html\"} \nBackground for title slide, not working in this version of Quarto -->\n```",
