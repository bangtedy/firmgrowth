Speciﬁcally, we research the multiple combinations of internal and external ingredients (states all conditions) required to accomplish the firm growth.\n\n- Using a sample of ﬁrms from Southeast Asia, we apply qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) - speciﬁcally, fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA)- to test the importance of each component in sales and employment growth.\n \n## three lines of research on firm growth {.scrollable}\n\n- Innovation has always attracted academic interest, and three lines of research stand out in this regard. \n- employment\n- economic growth\n- However, determining the essential factors that affect ﬁrms’ performance remains an open question \n- However, little is known about how interactions among internal and external that foster or hinder growth.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\n- Based on this research gap, this study's general hypothesis is that the variables most commonly used in the measurement of internal and external factors have different effects on the conditions for firm growth. \n- The model has been applied to micro and small, medium and large  enterprises in the SEA.\n\n## Questions to be answered\n\n- This study aims to answer the following research question: How do different and multiple conﬁgurations of internal and external factors: lead to firm growth.\n\n## Methodology\n\n- Considering possible complex combinations of the different conditions: creativity, innovation networks, and resources (Fiss, 2011; Ragin, 2008), we use a particular type of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) methodology: the fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA), a conﬁgurational method based on set theory that explains complex causality in terms of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions to achieve the analytical outcome (Misangyi and Acharya, 2014).\n- This proves there is no unique way to obtain growth (be it sales or employment growth), but several ways are possible based on the mix of ingredients in the recipe.\n\n## Contribution\n\n- This study provides insights into new ways of conceptualizing ﬁrms’ improvements in terms of making business environment right by implementing a “right-factors conﬁguration,” a map of combinations of innovation ingredients.\n- Rather than considering that firm growth based on correlation or the effects of independent variables on the outcome , instead this study considers it to be the result of the interaction of different conditions of internal and external\n\n## QCA:\n-  Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), an approach for establishing causal relationships between conditions and outcomes.\n- addresses causal complexity by identifying various causal “recipes” leading to the same outcome\n-  fsQCA seeks to establish logical connections between combinations of causal conditions and an outcome, the result being rules that describe how combinations of causal conditions would cause the desired outcome. \n- So, each rule is a possible path from the causal conditions to the outcome. \n- QCA is particularly effective in addressing challenges of complex causality, where different causal “recipes” can lead to the same outcome. \n- In contrast to classical correlational techniques, QCA is based on set theory, making it ideal for examining explicit connections and exploring diverse combinations of causal conditions. \n- An especially useful feature of QCA is its ability to analyze complex causality, defined as a situation where an outcome may result from various different combinations of causal conditions, or different “causal recipes.” \n- FsQCA is employed to analyze cases to identify relationships among present or absent conditions in the cases and the outcome of interest (Ragin, 2008). \n- In other words, this method aims to identify the conditions that are necessary or sufﬁcient for an outcome to occur (Gligor and Bozkurt, 2020). The results were examined for consistency and coverage. A high membership consistency is paramount because it implies that a condition will not exist in the presence or absence of the outcome. Coverage indicates the percentage of cases explained by a conﬁguration (causal combination of ingredients).\n\n## Steps\n\n- The steps to investigate QCA are as follows: (i) identiﬁcation of the conditions and outcome; (ii) analysis of the sample; (iii) calibration of conditions; (iv) necessity analysis; (v) “truth table” analysis; and (iv) sufﬁciency analysis.\n\n## Calibration\n\n- Before using fsQCA, the ﬁrst step is to transform raw data into datasets. \n- This step is known as calibration (Ragin, 2008) and indicates whether a value belongs to a set. Speciﬁcally, this study employed direct calibration, which deﬁnes three thresholds: completely in set (1), the point of maximum ambiguity (neither in nor out: 0.5), and entirely outside the set (0). \n- Table 1 shows the main descriptive statistics of the outcome variables and conditions, the external criteria used for calibration, and the cutoff points. For a detailed description of the calibration procedure, see Ragin (2008, pp. 86e94).\n\n## The main tool \n\n- The main tool for analyzing causal complexity using QCA is the truth table (Ragin 1987; 2000; \n2008), \n- a tool that allows for structured and focused comparisons. Truth tables list the logically possible combinations of causal conditions and the associated empirical outcome for each configuration. \n- In more complex analyses, the rows (representing combinations of causal conditions) can be quite numerous, as the number of causal combinations is an exponential function of the number of causal conditions (number of causal combinations = 2^k, where k is the number of causal conditions). \n\n- According to Ragin (2008), the key point is that the truth table elaborates and formalizes one of the main analytical strategies of comparative research—examining cases that share specific \ncombinations of causal conditions to see if they yield the same outcome. \n\n- In fact, the primary aim of truth table analysis is to identify explicit connections between combinations of causal conditions and outcomes. By listing the different logically possible combinations of conditions, it becomes possible to assess not only the sufficiency of a specific recipe but also the sufficiency of other logically possible combinations of conditions that can be constructed from these causal conditions. \n\n## The fsQCA variant: An overview \n\n- Fuzzy sets are simultaneously qualitative and quantitative as they incorporate both types of \ndistinctions in calibrating the degree of membership in the set. Therefore, fuzzy sets have many of the virtues of conventional interval and ratio scale variables, while at the same time allowing for a qualitative assessment (Ragin 2008; Rihoux and Ragin 2008). \n\n- A fuzzy set can be seen as a continuous variable that has been purposely calibrated to indicate the degree of membership in a well-defined and specified set. This calibration is only possible \nthrough the use of theoretical and substantive knowledge, essential for specifying three or more \nqualitative breakpoints. \n\n- By using fuzzy sets to assess theoretical set relations, both the outcome and \ncausal conditions can be represented in terms of membership scores. In calibration, all factors are transformed into fuzzy sets with a range of values from 0 to 1. \n\n- This can be done directly or indirectly, based on data and underlying theory. In the direct form, three qualitative thresholds (or breakpoints) are chosen, while in the indirect form, factors are calibrated based on qualitative assessments. \n\n- The thresholds define full membership, full non-membership, and intermediate membership, \nrepresenting the degree to which a case belongs to a set (Ragin 2000; 2006; 2008; Rihoux and Ragin 2008; Fiss 2011; Woodside 2014; Jang et al. 2015). \n\n- Next, fsQCA produces a truth table with 2^k rows (k being the number of predictors, and each row representing every possible combination), which is ranked based on frequency (i.e., the number of observations for each combination) and consistency (i.e., “the degree to which cases match the set-theoretic relations expressed in a solution”). \n\n- To obtain a minimum number of observations for evaluating the relationships, a frequency threshold is set. Additionally, the consistency threshold is set above the recommended cut-off of 0.85 (Ragin 2008). \n\n- Combinations above the consistency threshold are those that fully explain the outcome, meaning for these combinations, the outcome variable is defined as 1, and for the rest, it is defined as 0. fsQCA offers three sets of solutions (complex, parsimonious, intermediate) that need to be interpreted by the researcher. \n\n- The complex solution presents all combinations of conditions when logical operations are applied and are then simplified into parsimonious as well as intermediate solutions, as they are more straightforward to interpret (Ragin 2006; 2008; Fiss, 2011). \n\n\n## Necessity and sufﬁciency analyses\n\n- In particular, two models were analyzed (see Fig. 1). The fsQCA explained complex causality in terms of necessity and sufﬁciency. \n- A condition is deemed necessary if the outcome cannot occur without this condition, whereas it is sufﬁcient if the outcome occurs every time it is present (Legewie, 2013). Necessity and sufﬁciency analyses were carried out using the software R, `SetMethod` and `QCA`.\n\n## References\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \n# {background-iframe=\"grid-worms/index.html\"} \nBackground for title slide, not working in this version of Quarto -->\n```\n",
