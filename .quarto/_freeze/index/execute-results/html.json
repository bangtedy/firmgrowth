The better we become at production, the more and better suited the means that are available to us.\n\n- This is what `economic growth` means.\n\n## PPC and capitalist dynamics \n\n![](images/ppf.png){width=80% fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n- Growth requires increases in quantity and quality of input\n- Growth requires conditions and specific types of resources and capabilities\n- Firm growth requires flexibility to make changes in technology, workforce composition, product, location.\n\n## Research agenda\n\nDespite the difficulty imagining a modern economy without firm, the results of the current literature on the firm growth still vary between countries, which makes this field intriguing. \n\nThis variation of results strongly prompted several questions about the conditions behind this and created a strong desire to examine the conditions closely and, most importantly, investigate the potential \"causes of effects\" of firm growth.\n\n## Aims\n\nThe key objective of this thesis is to provide a deeper understanding of the \nconfigurations of some conditions and firm growth.\n\nIn particular, this research aims to answer the following three research questions: \n\n- Does a correlation exist between a more robust financial sector and \nstable long-term economic growth? \n\ntranslate into equifinality, asymmetry, etc\n\n## Benefits/contribution\n\nAdding further empirical evidence to this nexus is quite essential; however, examining the factors that may erode or promote this relationship is more imperative. \n\nDiscussing such factors justifies why the results vary between countries and assists policymakers in addressing issues that might erode this substantial influence before conducting national development plans to promote the financial sector. \n\n## Contribution\n\nThis thesis builds on the literature by creating and refining a broad and up-to-date new database based on the availability of relevant data to assess the relationship between financial development and economic growth and adds further evidence regarding financial development effects on economic growth.\n\n## Limitation\n\nLike most literature, limitations in data availability exist for some variables, such as the financial sector depth and informal institution dataset. \n\nDespite these concerns, this thesis created and refined a broad and up-to-date new database based \non the availability of relevant data. \n\n## Previous empirical works\n\nWith the availability of representative and comprehensive data sets --- much work has been done.\n\n- Regressions: \n  + The growth rate of a firm as *dependent variable*, \n  + Attempts were made to explain this rate in terms of a long list of other variables.\n\n## Results\n\nConfirmed:\n\n  + The heterogeneity of firm\n  +  Firm growth is highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict\n  \n- Discovered empirical regularities: the growth rate distributions follow a \"tent-shaped\" pattern.\n\n## Motivation\n\n- The core motivation for this thesis is the importance of economic growth for \ngeneral human well-being.\n- The second motivation is the importance of the firm\n\n\n## Theoretical framework {.scrollable}\n\n**Neoclassic**. Using the marginal calculation to explain actions of firms. It follows that specifically understood marginal cost is employed in order to represent optimization decisions from the point of view of the firm. Notwithstanding the market structure –  be it perfect competition, monopolistic competition or monopoly –  the firm acts according to the same neoclassical scheme of profit maximization presented by the point where the gradients of the marginal cost and the marginal revenue are equal.\n\n- *The black-box* firm of equilibrium price theory with the famous  $MR=MC$ rule. \n- The MC curve has a specific U- shape reflecting the variability. In the neo-classical scheme, what inhibits further production expansion are the increasing costs resulting from increasing the production. Meanwhile, as indicated by the research, many managers report in surveys that the factors inhibiting their further expansion.\n- Apparently it is not solely the marginal cost that makes firms to go into the standby position. \n- Then we can see that in the real economy the black box is not controlled by the force of MC = MR, but by something more fundamental.\n\n## profit maximization: can it be considered the firm’s objective? {.scrollable}\n\nAn inherent part of the scheme of equalizing marginal costs with marginal revenues constitutes a behavioral assumption concerning the rule of profit maximization (or “loss minimization” – in a short period profit maximization may bring the highest, though still negative profit). The greatest confusion in this approach is related to its formalization. \n\nNamely, in order for something to be really “maximized”, one must have full knowledge of the phenomenon analyzed, that is, they must know a closed mathematical presentation. \n\nOnly then can we meet the condition of reaching the maxima. In neoclassical approach it is possible because we assume knowledge of the demand function and cost function. Thanks to this, the gradients of MC and MR can be equaled. \n\nLet us start with a marginal revenue curve that is based on the knowledge of the demand function and possibility of plotting such a precise curve. Exclusive hard data used by firms concern sales statistics in various time intervals. They are historical data; however, they do not form a true demand curve but merely its one point at a single given time. The demand curve may be stable over time when it concerns preferences at a given time and only this point may become a historical fact. Therefore, any facts that an enterprise may establish historically are merely different points of different demand curves.\n\nIn practice, firms use many tools to generate an approximate version of a demand curve. Surveys, focus groups, market research, reports on other firms’ data and firms generating related products are the tools aiming at establishing the demand curve for a given time (or something of the sort). However, one \nmust keep in mind that such a curve cannot be generated for future events nor constitute a solid scientific forecast on future interest among customers. In other words, the demand curve is always forecasted, even for the past. It also concerns more stable conditions.\n\nWithout knowledge of MC and MR curves as available options (even probabilistic), one cannot talk about one existing parameter in the company that is then maximized. Of course, in economics, words can have very different meanings, but when treating such concept mathematically, the parameter of \nmaking a profit is not available in the form of data, hence using it as a form of decision-making compass is misdirected. Allocation and entrepreneurial decisions on part of the firm are speculative and constitute an attempt to discover the appropriate but not yet realized scenario. The firm has a range of available options and implements something like Simon’s “satisfying” strategy instead of maximization because it has to do with different goals, not necessarily limited to a simple and well-known comparative standard (Simon 1956)\n\nStating that a firm in a decision makes MR and MC equal seems to be completely out of place with the actual picture of the functioning enterprise. On the one hand, it is something that seems to reflect the core of the neoclassical message hidden in maximizing profits rule, but on the other hand we do not give up on a realistic approach to the analysis of the firm’s activities, because we do not downplay the context of uncertain future and speculative nature of allocation decisions\n\n**Real firms**\n\n  - Enact strategies, manage the creation and acquisition of information and knowledge, and that have internal organisational structures and processes.\n\n## What is a firm?\n\nA techno-functional entity\n\n- as a black box that transforms factor inputs into outputs---how production and cost functions interact with demand on the market, i.e. the emphasis is on technical matters and how firms function in the context of the market.\n\nAn institutional entity\n\n- identity, internal structure and external boundaries (Hodgson, 2002)\n\n## Firm growth {.scrollable}\n\n- One of the most burning topics concerning the firm is its size.\n- what exactly the “size” of a firm is:\n  + The firm’s impact can certainly be demonstrated by the total turnover, thus, the organizational unit’s ability to generate revenues.\n  + the firm’s perspectives or rather their current perception, we can have a look at its capitalization (market value). It reflects the expectations that the firm may start to generate income sometime \nin the future \n  + From the social point of view, a more important factor deciding of the firm’s \nsize may be the number of its employees. \n- until you reach it as a matter of degree\n\n## What is expansion? {.scrollable}\n\nIt seems that the size of a firm can expand on different levels depending on the activity the company takes over. The first category would be intra-industry expansion. It would consist primarily of taking over its competitors by means of direct acquisition or winning rivalry for customers. \n\nThe other category would be chain expansion.\n\nExtra-industry expansion, entering other markets that are further from the original one. They may be more or less adjacent markets. The boundary of this classification is **a matter of degree**.\n\nThis classification into various types of companies’ expansions immediately suggests some hints as to what barriers a company may inevitably come across, when trying to enter markets other than its current one. \n\n## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.scrollable}\n\nWhy then the emerging barriers to the growth of firms appear? Are they \ntransaction costs? The answer is both affirmative and negative. As it has been \ndemonstrated, a lot depends on how these costs are understood and how \nmuch we try to match observed reality with the conceptual scheme adopted. \nIn the light of the aforementioned directions of the firm’s expansion, a \nquestion may arise as to why the expansion is stopped in specific directions \n(not in general).\n\n- The answer lies within the borders of the competitive advantage of such a company. \n\nThis requirement of resources and capital, which would allow \nfor running separate management and production processes, puts a significant \nlimitation on the intra-industry expansion of many firms. They are not able to \nattract customers of other suppliers because each of them brings to the con-\nsumer market something unique that cannot be easily replicated.\n\n## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.scrollable}\n\nThis type of expansion has its own limitations that can be manifested either \nwhen creating new departments in the firm or when taking over other firms. \nVarious factors may include the incompatibility of management systems, for \nexample, different and limited computer systems (related to sales, accounting, \ninventory etc.), internal and control procedures (especially important for \nfranchises). An analogous issue concerns human resources management that can \nconstitute the greatest challenge. There are known cases of hostility of various \nteams from other firms that, when merging two independent entities, begin to \nbe hostile towards each other.\n\nIn the case of non-intra-industry expansion, that is, when the firm enters \nsecondary and farther markets (in case of both chain expansion and one that \ntakes place completely outside the industry), the limitations seem to be even \nwider than those relating to intra- industry expansion.\n\n## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.scrollable}\n\nAs it can be seen, all forms of expansion by the firm are accompanied by the risk of many drag chains that make it impossible. However, if we were to point out the strongest factors determining the obstacles, there would be three interrelated ones: (1) uncertainty, (2) competition and (3) lack of path dependence in the accumulation of capital. Uncertainty determines the inevitability of making mistakes in every action undertaken, as it has already been explained. \n\nCompetition means that there are always other entrepreneurs in markets who, in the environment of uncertainty, will succeed and fail at the same time as others do, interchangeably. And finally, the third decisive factor: there is no guarantee that past successes improve the decision-making of firms in subsequent rounds.\n\n## The message\n\n- A central message presented in this research is that in discussing firm growth requires both techno-functional and institutional foundations.\n- A firm as a techno-functional entity implies an ability to hire, buy and organise factors of production and contract for the sale of output. \n- This hiring, buying, organising and contracting implies a pre-existing institutional structure covering, for instance, legal and accounting systems. \n- Firm is complex heterogeneous\n- Firm gorwth is gradation\n- \n\n## two distinct institutional views\n\n- the firm as a governance structure and the firm as a locus of strategic control. \n- The governance perspective is driven by issues of efficient motivation, the strategic approach by issues of long-run focus. \n\n## An implication of the framework developed here\n\n- is that no universal status can be claimed for any particular theoretical perspective, i.e. a theoretical pluralism is required. \n- In addition, a key issue here is that it is a fundamentally empirical question as to which perspective is relevant and dominant in particular circumstances. \n- This empirically driven relevance opens up a significant, and open-ended, research agenda.\n\n## Adam Smith Growth Model {.scrollable}\n\nHis theory stipulates that the increased division of labour in modern \ntimes largely accounts for increases in the production scale and overall workforce \nproductivity (Meade, 2013).\n\nAcemoglu (2012) argued that these ideas concerning the division of labour play an essential role in business expansion projects. In the context of the contemporary business environment, the division of labour comprises a profitable approach only if the company has access to an adequate market \nfor its range of goods and services. -- conditional\n\nBecker (2017) argued that the division of labour acts as a critical driver for accelerating investment \nand capital accumulation. Companies have recorded substantial increases in both \nproduction output and living standards; thus, society has experienced an increase in \nliving standards. The author also argued that the importance of the division of labour \nis further enhanced in developed and industrialised nations. \n\nkey drivers of economic growth and success. These include population growth, capital or \ninvestment growth, the division of labour concerning technological progress, and the \napplication of appropriate modifications to the institutional framework of the \neconomy in the form of free-market trading. By considering several variables, \nbusinesses and government agencies can achieve significant success by working \ncollaboratively in the field of economic growth (Dopfer & Potts, 2015). \n\n## Harrod-Domar Model \n\nthe Harrod-Domar model views capital rather than labour as the main driver of economic growth. In other words, this model takes an abundance of suitably qualified labour for granted, and consequently, capital \nbecomes the bottleneck for economic growth. Therefore, increases in both the quantity \nand quality of available capital can lead to economic growth. \n\n## Keynesian Growth Model {.smaller}\n\nIn the labour- and capital-based growth theories above, economic growth is \nconstrained by the quantity and quality of available resources.\n\na lack of demand for production output may be a key factor limiting economic growth. In such situations, increases in spending by both the government and consumers may be required for economic growth. \n\nHe identified four key components of the output of economic goods and services (i.e. investment, consumption, government purchases, and net exports) and asserted that economic growth would result if an \nincrease in demand could be achieved for any of them.\n\n## Neoclassical Model and Solow growth model {.smaller}\n\nThe focus of this model is on capital accumulation as a primary \nelement of economic development. The model highlights capital and labour as the two \nkey drivers of production output but also takes into account other factors, such as \ntechnological progress.\n\n## Endogenous Growth Model\n\nMcCombie and Thirlwall (2016) stated that this model is based on the assumption that the long-term economic growth of a country is determined primarily by endogenous variables (i.e. internal elements of the organisational system, such as human capital, innovation, and investment capital). \nSuch variables as technological progress and scientific advancement, however, are \nconsidered dependent economic forces.\n\n## Fuzzy set\n\n- Missing in both views is recognition of the importance of the analysis of set relations in social research. Consider that almost all social science theory is verbal and, as such, is formulated in terms of sets and set relations.\n- Researchers in the social sciences have long observed that although human beings break up their world into categories, they often use categories with blurred edges and gradations of membership. This is also true of many concepts employed in the social sciences themselves.\n\n## A matter of degree\n\n- If firm growth is thought to be a matter of degree, then fuzzy set theory claims that we can \nstill meaningfully address the issue of how much the sets of firm that grow and financially constrained intersect. \n\n## Objectives\n\nThis thesis examines the firm growth and the conditions that may promote or mitigate the configuration, three countries in 2023.\n\n## Ini belum\n\n- Firms are heterogeneous on a large number of key dimensions, resources and capabilities.\n- Firms operate in diverse environment.\n- Different propensity to grow: majority do not grow, a small number enjoy very high growth rates, and many are not even interested in pursuing growth (@albulescuNonlinearRelationshipFirm2021; @coadScaleUpsHighGrowthFirms2024; @storeyUnderstandingSmallBusiness2016; @wiklundWhatTheyThink2003).\n\n## Complexity {.smaller}\n\n- Firms can operate in different condition and grow or they can operate in the same condition but do not grow. \n  + @coadFirmGrowthBarriers2012 found that some small firms are able to convert know-how into commercial success, while many others are unable to translate it into superior growth. \n  + @guerzoniWasRobertGibrat2024 found that small firms do not necessarily grow faster than their larger counterparts, depend on sector specific industry. \n  + Rapid growth firms are not concentrated in specific industries: labor or knowledge intensive industries; in manufacturing or service sector (@smallboneCharacteristicsStrategiesHigh1995; @storeyUnderstandingSmallBusiness2016). \n  + Idiosyncratic component even within industries: industries containing many fast-growing firms also contain a large number of firms experiencing rapid decline (@headdSmallBusinessGrowth2007).\n\n## Configurational {.scrollable}\n\n- @moreno-menendezHowFamilyBusinesses2021; @luSystemDynamicsModelling2023; @sahitiGrowthFirmsLessDeveloped2019 have started the idea that the unique configurations of external condition, resources and capabilities of firms are responsible for how much firms grow. \n- @sahitiGrowthFirmsLessDeveloped2019 revealed that firm growth cannot be assigned to one or other of these categories, but it is the interaction among macro and micro issues that counts. \n- We take up this idea that the prevailing way for firm to grow is the outcome of the configuration of sets of conditions.\n\n## Research Agenda {.scrollable}\n\n- To explore the degree to which firm heterogeneity (internal factors) and business environment (external factors) explain firm growth variability. \n- To explore configurations of factors suspected to causally influence firm growth.\n- Little is known about how configurations among internal and external that foster or hinder growth.\n\n## Theoretical background\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"font-size: 14px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption style=\"font-size: initial !important;\"></caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Theory </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Main_proponents </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Paradigm </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Growth_drivers </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Factors_identified </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> On_firms_flexibility_in_input_and_output </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Neoclassical Economics (NE) </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Viner, J.
