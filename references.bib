  abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between informal competition and innovation. In particular, we are concerned with how informal firms affect the product and process innovations of formal firms of South Asia. We introduce the moderating variables of innovation time off and R\&D intensity as components of absorptive capacity theory to analyse this relationship. Our results show that informal competition negatively affects both product and process innovations of formal firms. Innovation time off and R\&D intensity positively moderate the impact of informal competition for those firms that are innovating in both domains. Our findings suggest managers and owners of formal firms will benefit from providing free time to employees for creative ideas and investing in R\&D activities to reduce the negative effect of the informal sector. Our findings also provide insight to policy makers to formulate policies that encourage innovative behaviour within the formal sector of South Asia.},

The model generates a non-degenerate equilibrium firm size distribution driven by entry of new firms and expansion exit of existing firms. When there is also costly imitation preventing any sector from falling too far below the average, the stationary firm size distribution is Pareto with an exponent approximately equal to one (the so-called “Zipf distribution”).},

Is it culture, the weather, or geography that determines prosperity or poverty? As Why Nations Fail shows, none of these factors is either definitive or destiny.~Drawing on fifteen years of original research, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is our man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or the lack of it). Korea, to take just one example, is a remarkably homogenous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created those two different institutional trajectories. Acemoglu and Robinson marshal extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, among them:~• Will China’s economy continue to grow at such a high speed and ultimately overwhelm the West?~• Are America’s best days behind it? Are we creating a vicious cycle that enriches and empowers a small minority? “This book will change the way people think about the wealth and poverty of nations . . . as ambitious as Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs, and Steel.”—BusinessWeek},

It is clear from this analysis that a major challenge for political and economic reform in Central and Eastern Europe is to create the strong entrepreneurial sector which exists in the West.},

We use the survey data to construct a digital adoption index to evaluate the variations in digital adoption in the five business processes of e-procurement, POS, e-marketing, e-commerce, and digital payment. This index not only identifies whether a firm has adopted digital technology but also considers the dimensions of use to measure the level of adoption more precisely. Using the primary data, we employ a simple regression model, and the results demonstrate that owner demographic characteristics, firm-specific factors, business environment, connectivity infrastructure quality, and culture are associated with disparities in digital adoption by UMSEs. Our findings also reveal a positive and significant correlation between digital adoption on business performance. Based on a two-stage least squares (2SLS) model, we found strong evidence of the impact of digital adoption on UMSE owners’ level of financial literacy. The latter result suggests that improving digital adoption among UMSEs could enhance their financial literacy. Overall, these findings confirm the vital role of digital transformation for UMSEs to achieve growth and competitiveness in the global market, which requires robust support from policymakers.},

  abstract = {Turkish construction industry experienced a disproportionate growth in global markets between 2004 and 2017, almost quadrupling their share of world exports. This extraordinary success story is a puzzling case that cannot be straightforwardly explained by economic factors, since Türkiye is not known for having the lowest labour costs, highest access to financial resources or most advanced technologies in construction. To complement and extend the established approaches in the literature, this thesis examines social determinants of competitive advantage by building on arguments from institutionalist and network-based schools of thought and employing a nested mixed-methods comparative case study research design. The findings indicate that social determinants matter for creation of competitive advantage when considered in distinct configurations across different contexts and complement selected dimensions of Michael Porter’s (1990) National Diamond. Rather than consciously calculating demand, Turkish contractors extensively rely on signals from networks as proposed by Harrison White (1981, 2002), as well as institutional signals sourced from political, regulatory and cultural structures. They thrive in objectively bad institutional environments, by capitalizing on institutional similarities, mobilizing political ties and influences, adapting to local cultural conditions, and taking excessive risks. Their internationalisation performance significantly depends on interactions of institutional and interpersonal complementarities in host countries. The contributions of this thesis are fourfold. First, it adds substantially to the empirical body of knowledge by solving a real-life puzzle of extraordinary international growth of a national industry. Second, it develops a nuanced and testable framework for the sociology of competitive advantage. Third, it bridges different theoretical ideas from economic sociology, political economy and international business literatures, while extending theoretical arguments with new conceptual discoveries. Finally, it comparatively demonstrates advantages and disadvantages of using different methods in competitiveness research, as the first study that systematically applies regression, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and thematic qualitative content analysis techniques.},

A distressed firm exhibits both cash-flow and balance-sheet insolvency whereas a zombie firm is a distressed company that has received new credit. We carry out several analyses to test the validity of these definitions. For instance, we document that being distressed is negatively correlated with the probability of receiving new credit. However, the main bank of a distressed firm is more reluctant to restrict the credit supply to this firm than a bank with no previous exposure to the company, which might reflect the incentives of the former to engage in loan evergreening. This financial support contributes to keep zombie firms afloat for a longer period than distressed firms. Moreover, the contraction in capital, employment and sales is much larger in distressed firms than in zombie firms.},

Our results show that the individual characteristics of the firm have an important effect on both total factor productivity and labor productivity. We find that the oldest small firms are more productive than larger firms. Regional context has a significant direct impact on firms’ performance. More specifically, industrial density has a positive influence on total factor productivity. Our results show also that interaction effects or indirect effects are mostly driven by sectoral characteristics. The intra-industrial wage disparities are beneficial only for firms with higher human capital and R\&D. The interaction effects also show that larger and older firms will benefit more from industrial agglomeration. We conclude that multilevel models better fit our research questions that combine firm and contextual characteristics simultaneously, because they allow firm-specific characteristics to be differently associated to their regional and sectoral contexts.},

  abstract = {Recent empirical studies have shown that firm growth rate distribution is not Gaussian but closely follows a Laplace distribution. This robust feature of the growth rate distribution challenges existing models based on Gibrat’s model because it predicts a Gaussian distribution. First, we analyze more than 100,000 Japanese firms and empirically show that the Laplace shape can be observed for the Japanese firms. Then, by using the theory of stochastic processes, we theoretically show that the absence of jumps causes the discrepancy between Gibrat’s model and the Laplace shape. In particular, based on the Laplace shape and the law of proportionate effect, we show that the firm growth process is a jump process. In other words, firm growth cannot be explained by the consequence of many small shocks but is determined by a few large jumps. The widely observed Laplace distribution reflects this jump property of firm growth dynamics.},

  abstract = {The potential offered by the increasing availability of micro-geographic data is tremendous and still largely not exploited. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to study the spatial dynamics of firm demography making use of such rich source of information. Exploiting the techniques of stochastic spatial point processes (Diggle, Statistical analysis of spatial point patterns, 2003), it is indeed possible to model the firm birth, growth and death explaining the behavior of the individual economic agent. We consider the spatial distribution of the economic activities as the result of a dynamic process occurring in space and time, and we model the micro-spatial patterns as single realizations of marked space–time survival point processes (Rathbun and Cressie, J Am Stat Assoc 89:1164–1174, 1994). Within such a methodological framework firms are created at some random location and some point of time and then operate, grow, and attract (or repulse) the localization of other firms in their neighborhood. The proposed model is fitted to some empirical data on firms’ locations sourced from the ASIA harmonised archive of the Italian National Institute of Statistics. The empirical analysis reveals the presence of local competition behavior in firm creation among small retail food stores, thus shedding light on the phenomena of firm demography.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explain why the likelihood of survival and post-entry growth rates vary systematically from industry to industry. In particular, the post-entry performance of new firms is linked to the underlying technological conditions in an industry. In industries where innovative activity, and especially the innovative activity of small firms, plays an important role, the likelihood of new entrants' surviving over a decade is lower than in industries where innovative activity is less important. At the same time, those entrants that are able to survive exhibit higher growth rates. In addition, the conditional likelihood of surviving an additional two years for entrants that have already survived the first few years is actually greater, and not lower, in highly innovative industries. The evidence therefore suggests that a highly innovative environment exerts a disparate effect on the post-entry performance of new entrants. Those new firms that are able to adjust and offer a viable product apparently experience higher rates of growth and a greater likelihood of survival. But overall, entrants and certainly new firms that are not able to adjust and produce a viable product are confronted by a lower likelihood of survival in highly innovative environments.},

Our results show that (a) firm age decreases the likelihood of scaling, while firm size and scaling in prior period enhances the likelihood of scaling, (b) firms in regions with higher economic development are more likely to scale while the effect of localized knowledge spillovers from foreign employees on firm scaling depends on firm size.},

First, when both the proliferation of instruments problem and the biased standard error in SGMM are accounted for, the results reveal that only in non-inflation crisis countries does inflation harm growth, while inflation uncertainty promotes growth. Empirical results, based on a three-regime model, confirm the negative growth effect of high inflation rates and the growth enhancing effect of low inflation. Second, the negative-level effect of not keeping inflation in check outweighs the positive effect from uncertainty in non-inflation crisis countries in all three regimes. Third, the existence of a positive effect of uncertainty about the inflation rate on growth through a precautionary motive is confirmed when inflation reaches moderate ranges (5.6–15.9\%). These findings are robust, although only for non-inflation crisis countries, to a battery of diagnostic tests, including the issue of weak and the proliferation of instruments and biased standard error.},

  abstract = {Since the 1991 publication of the first Journal of Management special issue devoted to resource-based inquiry, resource-based theory (RBT) has evolved from a nascent, upstart perspective to one of the most prominent and powerful theories for understanding organizations. Indeed, 20 years after that landmark issue, RBT appears to have reached maturity as a theory. One implication of this maturity is that RBT lies at a critical juncture, one that will be followed either by revitalization of the theory or by its decline. In this introductory article, the authors provide a brief overview of the contributions provided by the commentaries and articles contained in this third Journal of Management special issue on RBT. These contributions center on five themes: interlinkages with other perspectives, processes of resource acquisition and development, the micro-foundations of RBT, RBT and sustainability, and method and measurement issues. Their view is that the commentaries and articles collectively offer a foundation for extending RBT in meaningful new directions and steering clear of decline. They also offer their thoughts about some key opportunities within each of the themes for further revitalizing research involving the RBT.},

  abstract = {Much of the current thinking about competitive strategy focuses on ways that firms can create imperfectly competitive product markets in order to obtain greater than normal economic performance. However, the economic performance of firms does not depend simply on whether or not its strategies create such markets, but also on the cost of implementing those strategies. Clearly, if the cost of strategy implementation is greater than returns obtained from creating an imperfectly competitive product market, then firms will not obtain above normal economic performance from their strategizing efforts. To help analyze the cost of implementing strategies, we introduce the concept of a strategic factor market, i.e., a market where the resources necessary to implement a strategy are acquired. If strategic factor markets are perfect, then the cost of acquiring strategic resources will approximately equal the economic value of those resources once they are used to implement product market strategies. Even if such strategies create imperfectly competitive product markets, they will not generate above normal economic performance for a firm, for their full value would have been anticipated when the resources necessary for implementation were acquired. However, strategic factor markets will be imperfectly competitive when different firms have different expectations about the future value of a strategic resource. In these settings, firms may obtain above normal economic performance from acquiring strategic resources and implementing strategies. We show that other apparent strategic factor market imperfections, including when a firm already controls all the resources needed to implement a strategy, when a firm controls unique resources, when only a small number of firms attempt to implement a strategy, and when some firms have access to lower cost capital than others, and so on, are all special cases of differences in expectations held by firms about the future value of a strategic resource. Firms can attempt to develop better expectations about the future value of strategic resources by analyzing their competitive environments or by analyzing skills and capabilities they already control. Environmental analysis cannot be expected to improve the expectations of some firms better than others, and thus cannot be a source of more accurate expectations about the future value of a strategic resource. However, analyzing a firm's skills and capabilities can be a source of more accurate expectations. Thus, from the point of view of firms seeking greater than normal economic performance, our analysis suggests that strategic choices should flow mainly from the analysis of its unique skills and capabilities, rather than from the analysis of its competitive environment.}

We develop a measure of local credit supply that is based on the market shares of the banks that serve a local economy and the national change in each bank’s lending that is attributable to supply factors (i.e., purged of local demand factors). The decrease in our credit supply indicator, which is strongly correlated to the outstanding loan dynamics, explains the 13\% of the contraction in real value added with respect to the pre-crisis period. The negative effects on the value added are heterogeneous across sectors and, in particular, are larger for the manufacturing sector. Moreover, the impact of the credit crunch is concentrated on the small firms, in the areas that are more dependent upon external finance and in the Central-Northern provinces. Finally, credit supply shocks affected lending but not real outcomes in the pre-crisis period.},

It shows that within-firm changes in productivity and net entry are the major sources of labor productivity growth in most countries. The measurement errors affect aggregation indicators such as the mean or sum of firm-level data. Differences in average firm size appear to be largely driven by within-sector differences, although in some countries sectoral specialization also plays a significant role. Moreover, the entry of small firms is relatively easy while larger-scale entry is more difficult, but survival among small firms is also more difficult. Surviving firms are relatively larger and tend to grow rapidly. The data show that virtually all the countries exhibit positive allocative efficiency.},

By contrast, young firms, which show stronger growth in stable times, are disproportionately negatively affected by the crisis. A similar pattern holds for firms showing characteristics commonly associated with a more entrepreneurial attitude. Thus we conclude that crises are detrimental to entrepreneurship.},

This confirms that roads are important for private output growth and, as our results are larger than those reported in the literature for developed countries, that transportation infrastructure is relatively more important for the economy of developing countries. We also identify a one-year time lag with which firms' outputs react to road stock changes. This could be indicative of firms requiring time to adjust their production to road changes. We furthermore identify that the effect of road infrastructure is particularly large for heavy manufacturing industries. Moreover, we investigate the regional heterogeneity of the role of transportation infrastructure for firms' output growth. Our results are robust to different econometric concerns. We additionally provide Monte Carlo simulations to support the validity of pseudo-panels in the context of firm-level data.},

We find that while firms engage in innovative activities with smaller probability, the smaller they are, for those firms that do make such investment, R\&D intensity is larger the smaller firms are. For all MSMEs, the predicted R\&D intensity is positively correlated with the probability of reporting innovation, with a larger effect size for product than for process innovations. Moreover, micro firms benefit in a comparable way from innovation processes as larger firms, as they are similarly able to increase their labor productivity. Overall, the link between R\&D, innovation, and productivity in micro firms does not largely differ from their larger counterparts.},

  abstract = {Why has capitalism produced economic growth that so vastly dwarfs the growth record of other economic systems, past and present? Why have living standards in countries from America to Germany to Japan risen exponentially over the past century? William Baumol rejects the conventional view that capitalism benefits society through price competition--that is, products and services become less costly as firms vie for consumers. Where most others have seen this as the driving force behind growth, he sees something different--a compound of systematic innovation activity within the firm, an arms race in which no firm in an innovating industry dares to fall behind the others in new products and processes, and inter-firm collaboration in the creation and use of innovations. While giving price competition due credit, Baumol stresses that large firms use innovation as a prime competitive weapon. However, as he explains it, firms do not wish to risk too much innovation, because it is costly, and can be made obsolete by rival innovation. So firms have split the difference through the sale of technology licenses and participation in technology-sharing compacts that pay huge dividends to the economy as a whole--and thereby made innovation a routine feature of economic life. This process, in Baumol's view, accounts for the unparalleled growth of modern capitalist economies. Drawing on extensive research and years of consulting work for many large global firms, Baumol shows in this original work that the capitalist growth process, at least in societies where the rule of law prevails, comes far closer to the requirements of economic efficiency than is typically understood. Resounding with rare intellectual force, this book marks a milestone in the comprehension of the accomplishments of our free-market economic system--a new understanding that, suggests the author, promises to benefit many countries that lack the advantages of this immense innovation machine.},

SMEs form a large part of private sector in many developed and developing countries. While cross-country research sheds doubt on a causal link between SMEs and economic development, there is substantial evidence that small firms face larger growth constraints and have less access to formal sources of external finance, potentially explaining the lack of SMEs’ contribution to growth. Financial and institutional development helps alleviate SMEs’ growth constraints and increase their access to external finance and thus levels the playing field between firms of different sizes. Specific financing tools such as leasing and factoring can be useful in facilitating greater access to finance even in the absence of well-developed institutions, as can systems of credit information sharing and a more competitive banking structure.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the correlation between firm size, growth and profitability along with other firm-specific variables (like leverage, competition and asset tangibility), macroeconomic variable (like GDP growth-business cycle) and stock market development variable (like MCR). Design/methodology/approach Using the COMPUSTAT Global database this work uses panel dynamic fixed effects model for nearly 12,001 unique non-financial listed and active firms from 1995 to 2016 for 12 industrial and emerging Asia–Pacific economies. This interrelationship was also examined for small, medium and large size companies classified based on three alternate measures such as total assets, net sales and MCR of firms. Findings The persistence of profits coefficient was found to be positive and modest. There is evidence of a negative size-profitability and positive growth-profitability relationship suggesting that initially profitability increases with the growth of the firm but eventually, overtime, gains in profit rates reduce, as size increases indicting that large size breeds inefficiency. The relationship between firm's leverage ratio and its asset tangibility is found to be negative with profitability. The business cycle and stock market development variables suggest a positive relationship with the profitability of firms. However, the significance of estimated coefficients was mixed and varied among different selected Asia–Pacific economies. Practical implications The study has economic implications on issues such as industrial concentration, risk and optimum size of firms for practicing managers of modern enterprise in emerging markets. Originality/value The analysis of the relationship between the firm size, growth and profitability is uniquely determined under a dynamic panel fixed effects framework using firm-specific variables along with macroeconomic and financial development determinants of profitability. This relationship is estimated for a large and new data set of 12 industrial and emerging Asia–Pacific economies. 研究目的 本研究擬探討公司的規模、成長和盈利能力之間的關係， 同時亦涵蓋公司特有的其它變量 （如愩杆作用， 競爭和資產的有形性）， 宏觀經濟變量 （如國內生產總值增長與景氣之循環）， 以及股市發展變量 (如MCR) 。 研究的設計/方法/理念 本研究以COMPUSTAT 全球資料庫、使用動態面板固定效應模型，涵蓋幾近12001間獨特的、非金融上市及活躍的公司、覆蓋期由1995年至2016年，涉及12個工業及新興的亞太經濟體。這相互關係分析研究亦於大、中及小型企業內進行，而這些企業就規模方面的分類是基於三個交替的測量而釐定的，如總資產、銷售淨額、以及企業的MCR。 研究結果 研究發現、利潤係數的持續性是正且適中不強的。有證據顯示、規模的大小與盈利能力是負相關的，而增長與盈利能力則為正相關；這暗示盈利能力初時會因企業的成長而增強，但隨著時間的推移最终當規模增大、利潤率的增長會下降，這提示我們：大的規模會導致效率低下。企業的杠桿比率與其資產有形性的關聯被發現與盈利能力成負相關。經濟週期及股市發展變量暗示與企業的盈利能力之關聯為正相關。唯估計係數的意義會因被挑選之各個不同亞太經濟體而有異和不統一的。 實際的意義 本研究對在新興市場的現代企業內工作的業務經理有其實際作用，因研究為他們在業務問題如產業集中度、危機、公司的最佳規模等問題上提供了經濟方面的啟示。 研究的原創性/價值 本研究分析公司規模、成長與其盈利能力的關係時，獨特之處是採用了動態面板固定效應模型，並於應用盈利能力的宏觀經濟和金融發展的決定因素的同時，也使用了企業特有的變量。而這關係的分析研究涵蓋12個工業及新興的亞太經濟體的龐大且新的數據集。},

  abstract = {This paper investigates whether the industrial relations climate in Indian states has affected the pattern of manufacturing growth in the period 1958–1992. We show that states which amended the Industrial Disputes Act in a pro-worker direction experienced lowered output, employment, investment, and productivity in registered or formal manufacturing. In contrast, output in unregistered or informal manufacturing increased. Regulating in a pro-worker direction was also associated with increases in urban poverty. This suggests that attempts to redress the balance of power between capital and labor can end up hurting the poor.},

  abstract = {Theoretical and empirical studies of firm–industry dynamics have extensively focused on the process of growth. Theory predicts innovation, efficiency, profitability and financial status as the central channels through which firms can possibly achieve outstanding growth performance. The question is whether such high-growth performance is sustained over time and, if so, what are the factors enabling persistent high-growth patterns. Exploiting panels of Italian, Spanish, French and UK firms, we relate high growth, persistent high growth and other growth patterns to measures of efficiency, innovativeness, profitability and financial conditions. We find that high-growth firms are characterized by higher productivity and leverage, and that persistent high-growth firms do not systematically differ from other high-growth firms in none of the considered economic and financial dimensions. The findings are robust across countries, manufacturing and services.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the contribution of high-growth firms (HGFs) to aggregate productivity growth, using Hungarian firm-level data. Three stylized facts emerge. First, output-based HGFs substantially outperform employment-based ones in terms of their productivity contribution: on average, sales-based HGFs contribute 5 times as much as employment-based ones. Further, the contribution of employment-based HGFs is negative in 48-50\% of industry-years, compared to 25-31\% for sales-based HGFs. Second, HGFs tend to contribute to productivity growth only during their high-growth phase but not afterwards. Third, HGFs’ contribution to productivity growth is higher in industries with more effective reallocation and with more young firms, but none of these are strong predictors of the HGFs’ contribution. Finally, we present a simple benchmark model to show that these patterns arise naturally under realistic correlation structures.},

The author delineates two gendered cultural structures: the family devotion schema and the work devotion schema. Respondents are caught in the conflict between each schema's competing vision of a worthwhile life. Older respondents are more likely to accept the devotion schema's definition of an irreconcilable conflict between work and family, prompting many to avoid marriage or childbearing. In contrast, many members of the youngest cohort, who came of age after the early 1970s women's movement, are refashioning the family devotion schema by subcontracting out domestic responsibilities while maintaining demanding careers. Yet, the family devotion schema continues to haunt all cohorts, enduring in its cognitive, normative, and emotional power. Gender, as expressed in cultural models of family, remains a powerful constraint on the hearts and minds of even professionally successful women.},

  abstract = {Are some management practices akin to a technology that can explain firm and national productivity, or do they simply reflect contingent management styles? We collect data on core management practices from over 11,000 firms in 34 countries. We find large cross-country differences in the adoption of management practices, with the US having the highest size-weighted average management score. We present a formal model of “Management as a Technology”, and structurally estimate it using panel data to recover parameters including the depreciation rate and adjustment costs of managerial capital (both found to be larger than for tangible non-managerial capital). Our model also predicts (i) a positive impact of management on firm performance; (ii) a positive relationship between product market competition and average management quality (part of which stems from the larger covariance between management with firm size as competition strengthens); and (iii) a rise in the level and a fall in the dispersion of management with firm age. We find strong empirical support for all of these predictions in our data. Finally, building on our model, we find that differences in management practices account for about 30\% of total factor productivity differences both between countries and within countries across firms.},

Management practices account for more than 20 percent of the variation in productivity, a similar, or greater, percentage as that accounted for by R\&D, ICT, or human capital. We find evidence of two key drivers to improve management. The business environment, as measured by right-to-work laws, boosts incentive management practices. Learning spillovers, as measured by the arrival of large "Million Dollar Plants" in the country, increase the management scores of incumbents.},

The survey data are matched with firm-level data from the Bureau van Dijks database ORBIS. , – The analysis shows that independence is a prime motive for enterprises, statistically significantly more so for family owners. Family owners are more prone to use either their own savings or loans from family and are more reluctant to resort to external equity capital. Our results indicate a potential “capital constraint paradox”; there might be an abundance of external capital while firm growth is simultaneously constrained by a lack of internal funds. , – The main limitation is that the study is based on cross-section data. Future studies could thus be based on longitudinal data. , – The authors argue that policy makers must recognize independence and control aversion as strong norms that guide entrepreneurial action and that micro- and small-firm growth would profit more from lower personal and corporate income taxes compared to policy schemes intended to increase the supply of external capital. , – The paper offers new insights regarding the value of independence and how it affects strategic decisions within the firm.},

We illustrate this in a theoretical framework where a borrower must expend costly effort to protect output from predation. We consider two possible equilibrium loan contracts. In the first, lenders leave the decision to protect output to borrowers. In the second, lenders set the standard of property protection as a precondition for lending. The second contracting regime results in a higher level of property rights enforcement. Significantly, the level of economic development determines the equilibrium contracting form and vice versa. Based on this analysis, we jointly determine the evolution of property rights and economic development. The analysis also sheds light on the environments that lead an economy to a low development trap with a poor quality of property rights institutions.},

On the one hand it increases capital formation and growth. On the other hand it encourages bad borrowing practices. Thus there exists an optimal level of property rights which maximizes growth.

Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

We find that the program had a significant impact on the number of patent applications, more markedly in the case of smaller firms. Our results also show that the program was successful in increasing the likelihood of applying for a patent, but only for smaller firms. Our estimates show that one additional patent application requires grants of between €206,000 and €310,000 to the firms.},

  abstract = {Increasing the number of high growth firms (HGFs) is now a major focus for industry policy in developed countries. However, existing approaches are proving ineffective. Simply creating supportive framework conditions is insufficient. Creating favourable environments for business start-ups is not leading to the creation of more HGFs. And transactional forms of support for HGFs (e.g. financial assistance) are proving to have limited effectiveness, at least post-start-up. The entrepreneurship ecosystem approach has emerged as a response. It recognises that HGFs flourish in distinctive types of supportive environment. Distinguishing features of entrepreneurial ecosystems include the following: a core of large established businesses, including some that have been entrepreneur-led (entrepreneurial blockbusters); entrepreneurial recycling – whereby successful cashed out entrepreneurs reinvest their time, money and expertise in supporting new entrepreneurial activity; and an information-rich environment in which this information is both accessible and shared. A key player in this context is the deal-maker who is involved in a fiduciary capacity in several entrepreneurial ventures. Other important aspects of an entrepreneurial ecosystem include its culture, the availability of start-up and growth capital, the presence of large firms, universities and service providers. However, studies have tended to take a static approach to the study of entrepreneurial ecosystems, largely ignoring both their origins and stimulus and also the processes by which they become self-sustaining. Creating entrepreneurial ecosystems poses various challenges for policy-makers. There are several general principles that need to be followed. Policy intervention needs to take a holistic approach, focusing on the following: the entrepreneurial actors within the ecosystem; the resource providers within the ecosystem; entrepreneurial connectors within the ecosystem and the entrepreneurial environment of the ecosystem. Finally, it is important that policy-makers develop metrics in order to determine the strengths and weaknesses of individual ecosystems so that their strengths and weaknesses can be assessed, to identify whether and how to intervene, and monitor over time the effectiveness of such interventions. What to measure, approaches to measurement and access to data at the appropriate geographical scales all pose formidable challenges.1},

  abstract = {Business growth is considered a worthy goal for firms and a measure of entrepreneurial success, as well as important for economic development. Why some firms grow and others do not, though, remains a subject of debate. Of the small proportion of firms that do grow, it is often assumed that they follow a similar growth trajectory and/or encounter certain stage thresholds; however, the evidence base on this is wanting. The new study of business growth presented here provides an in-depth analysis of 19 New England-based firms. Our findings reveal that fast-growing companies exhibit different rates and patterns of growth: some display rapid growth trajectories (Rapid Growth Pattern); some, slower, more measured rates (Incremental Growth Pattern); others, episodic periods of quick growth followed by sharp retrenchment (Episodic Growth Pattern); and, while no firm actively chose to stop growing, some reached points of stagnation (Plateau Growth Pattern). We found that three key factors—management, marketing, and money—affected company growth across these patterns. While not every factor was critical at each moment of growth for each firm, every entrepreneur cited the relative importance of each factor at some time during the growth of their firm. Thus, fast-growing firms do not grow in the same manner, at the same rate, or with the same outcomes. This article has implications for those seeking to understand the processes of development and patterns of fast-growth businesses.},

  abstract = {We investigate the association between perceived barriers to innovation and the allocation of public support for innovation in manufacturing and service industries in Colombia, as well as the potential heterogeneity of returns to innovation across the firm-level productivity distribution. Extending the CDM recursive system, we include an equation for the allocation of direct support and use quantile regression methods to estimate the productivity equation. We find some differences across manufacturing and service industries. Financing constraints are correlated with obtaining public support in manufacturing and in some services, but in knowledge-intensive services (KIS) barriers associated with regulations are more significant. The introduction of innovations increases mostly the productivity of firms below the median of the productivity distribution, especially in services. Increasing human capital would boost productivity of firms in all industries, providing support to the hypothesis that human capital is indeed a bottleneck for productivity growth across the board in Colombia. We conclude that addressing factors that hinder innovation by low-productivity firms in all service industries could significantly contribute to increasing productivity and reduce its dispersion.},

The study analyzes the time paths of the predicted impacts in a randomized trial providing financial incentives to bank agents (on the supply-side) and basic business training to women business owners (on the demand-side) to facilitate their access to and use of formal financial services. The trial took place over a two-year period in 401 villages in five regencies of East Java province, Indonesia. Although predicted impacts of the treatments are positive and increasing over time for seven of eight economic empowerment outcomes analyzed, their time paths vary, with business profits and household income increasing sharply in the second year after increasing very little during the first year while business capital, improved business practices, personal savings and women’s agency increased linearly with time following treatment. A mediation analysis using a structural equations model finds significant direct and indirect effects between these economic empowerment-related outcomes: business practices, business capital and women’s agency contribute directly to increased business profits while personal savings, business profits itself and household income are indirect drivers; further, both treatments had a strong direct impact on household income that was reinforced by the direct effects of increased business profits. The article’s findings are consistent with other incipient evidence on the delayed effects of some interventions targeting women’s economic empowerment. They underline the need to measure impacts over a sufficiently long period, which in this case is at least two years after exposure to the treatments.},

However, to date, entrepreneurial ecosystem research has been largely atheoretical and static, and it focused mostly on advanced economies. In this paper, we therefore do two things. We first systematically review entrepreneurial ecosystem literature and propose a conceptual model that explicates three entrepreneurial ecosystem dynamics based on resource, interaction, and governance logics, respectively. We then systematically review empirical studies of emerging economy entrepreneurial ecosystems to build a theoretical framework that highlights their salient features. We reveal three key findings that challenge the direct application of the model vis-à-vis advanced economy entrepreneurial ecosystems to emerging economy entrepreneurial ecosystems: resource scarcities, structural gaps, and institutional voids. Our findings contribute to entrepreneurial ecosystem literature in terms of ecosystem dynamics and contextualizing entrepreneurial ecosystems in emerging economies. We also provide policy implications for emerging countries in fostering new venture creation.},

Using a Pharmaceutical Industry Database (1987–1998), we find evidence against Gibrat's law on average, within or across industries. Estimated steady states differ across firms, and firm sizes and growth rates do not converge within the same industry to a common limiting distribution. There is only weak evidence of mean reversion: initial larger firms do not grow relatively slower than smaller firms. Differences in growth rates and in steady state size are persistent and firm-specific, rather than size-specific.},

It first reviews the academic literature on development and highlights the fundamental importance of institutions and social values, over and above other alternative theories, as determinants in long-run development. In this context, the book draws from the works of Nobel Laureates Douglass North, F.A. Hayek and Elinor Ostrom, and argues that the ingredients of property rights, the rule of law, and market freedoms are essential in generating socio-economic progress.  Successful reforms however are not simply a function of constructing formal institutions, but must cohere with the social values, norms, and cultural commitments of local communities. It is in this spirit that the book theorises on the oft-neglected role that political entrepreneurs play in driving endogenous institutional change. Specifically, this book integrates the theoretical discussion on market-driven development with a range of case studies from around the world, featuring the bottom-up efforts of local change agents to pursue institutional reforms and changes in social opinion.},

This effect holds robust after controlling for city characteristics. Cities with higher bank concentration have less entrepreneurship and labor income. We use China's 2009 bank deregulation as a quasi-natural experiment, and find that the shock leads to significant increases in population growth for cities with new entry of joint-stock banks and city commercial banks. We argue the deregulation increases credit supply, which relieves local households' financial constraints and improves population growth.},

The imprints of institutional environment in founding phase and incurred current behavior preferences contribute to divergent productivities, isolating the effect of intervention from the alternative explanation about resource endowment discrepancy across restructured and entrepreneurial family firms.},

This implies that the quality and export gaps between more and less productive exporters increase as the financial system improves.

Previous research has linked high-growth episodes to the configuration of lumpy indivisible resources inside firms, such that high capacity utilisation levels might stimulate future growth. We theorize that firms reaching critically high capacity utilisation levels reach a “trigger point” involving either broad-based investment in further growth or shrinking back to previous levels. We analyze EIBIS survey data (matched to ORBIS) which features a question on time-varying capacity utilisation. Overcapacity is a transitory state. Firms enter into overcapacity after a period of the rapid growth of sales and profits, and the years surrounding overcapacity have higher employment growth rates. Firms operating at overcapacity make incremental investments (e.g. capacity expansion, process improvements and modern machinery) rather than investing in R\&D and new product development. We find support for the “fork in the road” hypothesis: for some firms, overcapacity is associated with launching into massive investments and subsequent sales growth, while for other firms, overcapacity is negatively related to both investments and sales growth.},

Based on intuitions that EEs are persistent, we investigate whether regional HGF shares are persistent, using census data for 2 European countries taken separately (Croatia for 2004–2019, and Slovenia for 2007–2019). Overall, there is no clear persistence in regional HGF shares – regions with large HGF shares in one period are not necessarily likely to have large HGF shares in the following period. This is a puzzle for EE theory. In fact, there seems to be more persistence in industry-level HGF shares than for regional HGF shares. We formulate a ‘broken clock’ critique – just as a broken clock is correct twice a day, EE recommendations may sometimes be correct, but are fundamentally flawed as long as time-changing outputs (HGF shares) are predicted using time-invariant variables (such as local universities, institutions, investments in R\&D and infrastructure).},

  abstract = {An against-the-grain polemic on American capitalism from New York Times bestselling author Tyler Cowen.We love to hate the 800-pound gorilla. Walmart and Amazon destroy communities and small businesses. Facebook turns us into addicts while putting our personal data at risk. From skeptical politicians like Bernie Sanders who, at a 2016 presidential campaign rally said, “If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,” to millennials, only 42 percent of whom support capitalism, belief in big business is at an all-time low. But are big companies inherently evil? If business is so bad, why does it remain so integral to the basic functioning of America? Economist and bestselling author Tyler Cowen says our biggest problem is that we don’t love business enough. In Big Business, Cowen puts forth an impassioned defense of corporations and their essential role in a balanced, productive, and progressive society. He dismantles common misconceptions and untangles conflicting intuitions. According to a 2016 Gallup survey, only 12 percent of Americans trust big business “quite a lot,” and only 6 percent trust it “a great deal.” Yet Americans as a group are remarkably willing to trust businesses, whether in the form of buying a new phone on the day of its release or simply showing up to work in the expectation they will be paid. Cowen illuminates the crucial role businesses play in spurring innovation, rewarding talent and hard work, and creating the bounty on which we’ve all come to depend.},

We challenge this assumption by examining more than 12,000 nascent, young, and hyper-growth firms. Results reveal that variables which play central roles in resource-, cognition-, action-, and environment-based entrepreneurship theories exhibit highly skewed power law distributions, where a few outliers account for a disproportionate amount of the distribution's total output. Our results call for the development of new theory to explain and predict the mechanisms that generate these distributions and the outliers therein.

  abstract = {A fundamental discovery in entrepreneurship is that firm outcomes do not follow a symmetrical Gaussian curve. Instead, most are heavily right-skewed distributions in which a few extreme outliers (e.g., rock star firms like Airbnb, Tesla, and Uber) account for a disproportionate amount of the output. Although past research usually described outcome distributions as shaped following the power law, our study asks the following question: What other less extreme distributions of generalizable firm outcomes exist in entrepreneurship? Our investigation leverages four representative datasets from the U.S., Europe, and Australia, comprising 32 samples with about 22,000 ventures. We implemented a precise data-analytic approach that compares each sample (i.e., empirical distribution) against multiple theoretical distribution shapes to identify the best fit. Results showed that, across nearly all samples, the pure power law was not the dominant distribution. Instead, the annual revenue distribution is shaped as a power law with an exponential cutoff, and the number of employees distribution is shaped lognormally. Combined, these suggest the existence of top-down limitations on the highest performing firms. Accordingly, we offer an agenda for future research focused on (a) identifying and releasing systemic constraints, (b) examining and falsifying the underlying generative mechanisms that cause the emergence of heavy-tailed distributions and the outliers therein, and (c) conducting multi-level, mixed-method studies to investigate how micro-level interactions aggregate into macro-level heavy-tailed distributions. Our paper makes significant contributions to the power law perspective and future efforts to explain and predict the emergence of rock star firms in entrepreneurship.},

  abstract = {We advance a multilevel argument that challenges and qualifies existing explanations of firms' responses to institutional pressures. In an in-depth study of 17 multinational corporations involving 359 interviews with internal and external actors, we find that firms facing identical pressures decouple policy from practice in different ways and for different reasons. When firms' responses are generated locally, without firmwide coordination, these responses can be either intentional or emergent. In the presence of information asymmetry between firms and their stakeholders, we find that managers' responses are intentional (“faking it”) and depend on how they perceive their interests. In the presence of competing stakeholder expectations, responses are emergent (“muddling through”) and depend on the degree of consensus among managers in their readings of the environment. These findings suggest that theories of decoupling need to be broadened to include the role of “muddling through” and the interplay of internal managerial and external stakeholder dynamics.},

Specifically, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis is used to determine whether these factors (individually or in combination) are necessary or sufficient conditions for high or low voter turnout. To date, this method has never been applied to the study of voter turnout and this study attempts to fill this gap. The main conclusion is that corruption harms democracy by lowering voter turnout. The analysis also provides evidence that trust in parliament affects political participation and that the persistence of low educational attainment in a country, together with high inequality, is a sufficient condition for low turnout. Overall, the results suggest the importance of fighting corruption for citizen participation in democracy. They also show that measures to increase turnout should combine improvements in democratic institutions, education, and distributive justice.},

From a sample of 471 non-financial companies from the USA for the period 2008–2010, our findings support the four tenets of complexity theory: equifinality, complexity, asymmetry, and causal asymmetry. More concretely, they suggest that CSR performance depends on a complex configuration of some board characteristics, such as size, independency, diversity and activity, and other corporate attributes (i.e., company size, leverage, and growth opportunities). These factors play a key role as the ingredients of the recipe and, in a proper combination, contribute to obtaining high levels of social responsibility performance.

In this paper we define HGFs using the commonly applied growth indicators (employment and sales), but also add definitions based on growth in value added and productivity. Our results indicate that HGFs in terms of employment are not the same firms as HGFs in terms of productivity, and that their economic contributions differ significantly. Economic policy promoting fast growth in employment may therefore come at the cost of reduced productivity growth. Although HGFs of different definitions may not be the same firms, young firms are more likely to be HGFs irrespective of definition. This suggests that economic policy should focus on the conditions for new firm formation and early growth of firms, rather than target a particular type of HGFs.},

  abstract = {Studies of small firm growth are no longer short in supply. On the contrary, as demonstrated by recent reviews, dozens and dozens of empirical research studies on this topic can be compiled. This does not necessarily mean that we know everything we want to know about small firm growth. In fact, all of the authors of recent review articles complain that a coherent picture is not easy to distil from the material. This is likely due to differences in theoretical and epistemological perspectives and interpretations; operationalizations; empirical contexts; modelling and analysis approaches, as well as the inherent complexity of the phenomenon itself. Thus, not only a superficial but also a rather deep reading of the extant literature easily leaves the reader confused and wondering. Admitting that, we will focus in this paper on the fact that significant progress has been made and that we do actually know quite a bit now about the phenomenon of small firm growth; its antecedents and effects, and how it can or should be studied. It is not possible within the confines of a conference paper—and possibly outside the capacity of these authors—to give a complete account of that knowledge. What we will attempt is a summary of points of convergence within some key themes. We first discuss the nature of the phenomenon of small firm growth and its relation to entrepreneurship. Here we discuss the fact that the concept ‘growth’ is used both for ‘change in amount’ and for the process that leads to that change. We also note that part of the reason for lack of coherence in previous research is the heterogeneous nature of growth; firms can expand along different dimensions and show many different growth patterns over time. As regards the relationship between growth and entrepreneurship we conclude that at least early growth of new ventures is part of the entrepreneurship phenomenon. We then move on to how growth can best be assessed. This involves decisions about number of time periods; choice of specific indicator(s) and growth formulae, and the like. We conclude that ideally, growth should be assessed as size changes over multiple periods, preferably in a concurrent, longitudinal design. While sales growth is the most generally applicable measure, theoretical and industry-specific concerns should also influence the choice of indicator(s). A major section is devoted to the long list of internal and external factors that have been hypothesized and shown to influence firm growth. It is probably the case that every theoretically reasonable suggestion for a growth determinant has been shown to have the predicted impact in some context. We argue that the problem is to develop better knowledge about the relative and combined effects of the many predictors under different circumstances. One way to deal with this problem is to increase the level of abstraction and regard the many particularities as aspects of more over-riding factors, some of which influence growth directly while others only have an indirect impact. Another is to give up ambitions of approaching full explanation but instead enhance our understanding of the interplay among a smaller set of specific factors. A third is to limit the study to a more homogenous empirical context and generalize only to that context until replications have shown broader generalization is warranted. We then turn to how small firms grow, if at all. This concerns issues of organic vs. acquisition-based growth; internationalisation; integration; diversification, etc. One striking result here is the very marked difference between young and small vs. large and mature growing firms in that the former mainly grow organically while the latter achieve the bulk of their growth through acquisitions. This has some overlap with the next topic, which is ‘growth stages and transitions’, but as the latter is a relatively separate stream in the literature we keep it as such. We note that the critique of this literature seems to have led not to better research but to no research at all in this stream more recently. This is unfortunate because it represents the type of knowledge small firm managers typically need and demand. Before concluding, we also treat the relationship between growth and profitability. Surprisingly few studies have investigated this crucial relationship. Recent findings indicate that firms that grow successfully do so by first securing profitability, and then go for growth. This is strong reason to caution against a universal and uncritical growth ideology. As it appears, firms that grow at low profitability often end up in the undesirable state of low growth and low profits instead. This also puts small-firm managers’ widespread reluctance to pursue growth in a different light. Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary of what our review implies for the design of further studies on small firm growth.},

  abstract = {Purpose Microenterprises in emerging economies are known to operate in turbulent and resource-scarce environments. We test our hypothesis that a more comprehensive “Integrated Capital-Based Model” (ICBM) is needed when explaining the performance of microenterprises in such an environment. The model combines traditionally researched financial, human and social capital with more recently emphasized psychological and cognitive capital, providing greater explanatory power than models using only the traditional types of capital. Design/methodology/approach We use a pooled linear regression to analyze an existing survey of more than 900 independent business owners who were interviewed seven times between 2008 and 2012 in the Accra and Tema marketplaces in Ghana. We measure the performance of microenterprises using three dependent variables (revenue, profits, and productivity). We contrast the explanatory power of ICBM models against the more traditional models. Findings The ICBM has significantly higher levels of explanatory power over the traditional models in examining the performance of these microenterprises. These results highlight the importance of psychological and cognitive capital in emerging economies. Research limitations/implications We advocate for a more comprehensive view of capital as shown in our ICBM. However, the data were gathered only in an urban setting, which limits the generalizability to rural parts of emerging economies. Practical implications These findings suggest the utility of government and appropriate agencies finding ways to enhance the level of psychological and cognitive capital of microenterprise owners. Originality/value This paper's originality stems from hypothesizing and empirically confirming the higher predictive efficacy of ICBM against more traditionally researched capital sources.},

  abstract = {We examine new self-employment entry and its viability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, using a rich household survey for the years 2001–2004. We find that wealthier households are more likely to engage in viable self-employment and create employment suggesting an important role for financing constraints. Specifically, although having an existing bank relationship is not significantly related to the entry decision, it is positively related to the survival for new entrepreneurs and their employment creation. We also find a non-linear relationship between remittances and entry in that individuals not receiving remittances are more likely to enter self-employment; but, if they do receive them, the likelihood of starting a business increases in the fraction of wealth received from domestic remittances. Finally, people working in the informal sector are more likely to become viable entrepreneurs, particularly those provided with loans from micro-credit organizations. These findings support the perception of the informal sector as an incubator for formal self-employment in the early years of transition.},

Using firm-level data for 40 countries, we compute the proportion of firms in each country relying on external finance and examine how that proportion differs across financial systems. We find that the development of a country's legal system predicts access to external finance, and stock markets and the banking system affect access to external finance differently.

The empirical analysis is based on a novel corruption dataset we developed on local corruption in China at various disaggregation levels. The empirical results using fixed effects and instrumental variable estimation methods suggest that corruption has an economically and statistically significant negative effect on firm productivity. The estimated economic cost of corruption is found to be high; a one standard deviation increase in corruption reduces firm TFP by around 3.8\%. We also find that firm heterogeneity shapes business reactions to corruption in a given geographical location. Increasing corruption hurts firms less when they are publicly owned, export-oriented, more profitable, have faster growth, or operate in industries with lower levels of competition. We also show that firms in cities with higher levels of human capital and higher levels of public spending on education and scientific research are less sensitive to corruption. As for transmission channels, we find that corruption is likely to hurt TFP through its negative effects on private ownership, investment rate, export intensity, innovation, leverage, employment growth, and profit.},

The second type of impediment, which we label deterring barriers, encompasses the obstacles that prevent firms from committing to innovation. We use data from the 4th UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS4) to investigate the relationship between firms’ engagement in innovation and their assessment of the barriers to innovation. We show that the relationship is curvilinear in the case of costs and market barriers. These results have important implications for innovation policy and innovation management.},

Using a simple theoretical framework, we show that international trade systematically affects the distribution of firm size: the power law exponent among exporting firms should be strictly lower in absolute value than the power law exponent among non-exporting firms. We use a dataset of French firms to demonstrate that this prediction is strongly supported by the data, both for the economy as a whole and at the industry level. Furthermore, the differences between power law coefficients for exporters and non-exporters are larger in sectors that are more open to trade. While estimates of power law exponents have been used to pin down parameters in theoretical and quantitative models, our analysis implies that the existing estimates are systematically lower than the true values. We propose two simple ways of estimating power law parameters that take explicit account of exporting behavior.},

  abstract = {Firms in developing countries face numerous and serious constraints on their growth, ranging from corruption to lack of infrastructure to inability to access finance. Countries lack the resources to remove all the constraints at once and so would be better off removing the most binding one first. This paper uses data from World Bank Enterprise Surveys in 2006-10 to identify the most binding constraints on firm operations in developing countries. While each country faces a different set of constraints, these constraints also vary by firm characteristics, especially firm size. Across all countries, access to finance is among the most binding constraints; other obstacles appear to matter much less. This result is robust for all regions. Smaller firms must rely more on their own funds to invest and would grow significantly faster if they had greater access to external funds. As a result, a low level of financial development skews the firm size distribution by increasing the relative share of small firms. The results suggest that financing constraints play a significant part in explaining the "missing middle" -- the failure of small firms in developing countries to grow into medium-size or large firms.},

They are so ‘natural’ that they sound even more obvious than the Euclidian postulates in mathematics. But are they? What do they actually mean? Start with “demand curves”. Are they hypothetical ‘psychological constructs’ on individual preferences? Propositions on aggregation over them? Reduced forms of actual dynamic proposition of time profiles of prices and demanded quantities? Similar considerations apply to “supply curves” The point here, drawing upon the chapter by Kirman and Dosi, in Dosi (Dosi, Foundations of Complex Evolving Economies Innovation, Organization and Industrial Dynamics, Oxford University Press, 2023), is that the forest of demand and supply curves is basically there to populate the analysis with double axiomatic notions of equilibria, both ‘in the head’ of individual agents, and in environments in which they operate. Supply and demand “curves”, I am arguing, are one of the three major methodological stumbling blocks on the way of progress in economics, the other related ones being ‘utility functions’ and ‘production functions’. There is an alternative: represent markets and industries how they actually works, and model them both via fully fledged Agent Based Models and via lower dimensional dynamical systems.},

The article presents the logic and methodology of necessary but not sufficient contributions of organizational determinants (e.g., events, characteristics, resources, efforts) to a desired outcome (e.g., good performance). A necessary determinant must be present for achieving an outcome, but its presence is not sufficient to obtain that outcome. Without the necessary condition, there is guaranteed failure, which cannot be compensated by other determinants of the outcome. This logic and its related methodology are fundamentally different from the traditional sufficiency-based logic and methodology. Practical recommendations and free software are offered to support researchers to apply NCA.},

Using plant-level data for seven regional manufacturing industries in the U.S., we find that a producer's experience at the time it enters a market plays an important role in the exit decision, affecting both the overall probability of exit and the method of exit. After controlling for observable plant and market variables that affect profits, there remain systematic differences in exit patterns across three groups of plants distinguished by their prior experience: de novo entrants, experienced plants that enter by diversifying their product mix, and new plants owned by experienced firms. The results indicate that the exit decision cannot be treated as determined solely by current and future plant, firm, and market conditions, but that the plant's history also plays an important independent role in conditioning the likelihood of survival.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on dynamic capabilities and, more generally, the resource-based view of the firm. We argue that dynamic capabilities are a set of specific and identifiable processes such as product development, strategic decision making, and alliancing. They are neither vague nor tautological. Although dynamic capabilities are idiosyncratic in their details and path dependent in their emergence, they have significant commonalities across firms (popularly termed ‘best practice’). This suggests that they are more homogeneous, fungible, equifinal, and substitutable than is usually assumed. In moderately dynamic markets, dynamic capabilities resemble the traditional conception of routines. They are detailed, analytic, stable processes with predictable outcomes. In contrast, in high-velocity markets, they are simple, highly experiential and fragile processes with unpredictable outcomes. Finally, well-known learning mechanisms guide the evolution of dynamic capabilities. In moderately dynamic markets, the evolutionary emphasis is on variation. In high-velocity markets, it is on selection. At the level of RBV, we conclude that traditional RBV misidentifies the locus of long-term competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overemphasizes the strategic logic of leverage, and reaches a boundary condition in high-velocity markets.

  abstract = {Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) was originally developed to address configural research questions with a small to medium number of cases (i.e., N\,{$<$}\,50), allowing researchers to preserve the iterative nature of the data collection and interpretation that stems from a deep knowledge of cases. Recently, researchers have increasingly applied QCA within large-N applications involving anywhere from 50 to several thousand cases. Although the increasing popularity of using QCA in large-N research is promising, critical questions persist regarding QCA application. We conducted a scoping review of large-N QCA studies published in peer-reviewed journals over a 15-year period. Although the review showed some adherence to good practices for conducting QCA, it also revealed substantial gaps in large-N studies reporting analytic decision making, analysis, and results. We offer several recommendations for improving the reporting of large-N QCA studies.},

The best characterization of a firm therefore is that of a competent team (Eliasson 1990).                      However competent a firm is, it still operates in complex markets populated by rival firms, each of which is constantly having to make up its mind, not only about what their customers want to buy and about what technologies to choose, but also about what other firms and the Government plan to do. This in turn depends on what they expect you to plan to do. The totality of that market game has no determinate solution. The market situation of the individual actor therefore becomes a never-ending life in for them fundamentally unpredictable markets that may suddenly and unexpectedly threaten their very existence (Eliasson 1991a, 2020). Business agents are therefore boundedly rational in the sense of Herbert Simon (1955), or even fundamentally ignorant and failure prone in the sense that their ex ante expectations rarely come true ex post. Economic mistakes become a normal (transactions) cost of economic development. Hence, decisions of firms are best characterized as business experiments based on decision models about their environment (Eliasson 1992), designed to be confronted with those of other firms and thus tested in markets. Firms are therefore best understood as experimentally organized decision makers (Eliasson 1996:Ch.III).},

We discuss the relevance of each of these three aspects and argue that carefully considering these will improve the quality of QCA applications.}

The title of the book, as you may recognize was motivated (excuse me for using this very mild expression) by Daniel Dennett’s Consciousness Explained [130]. Dennett’s intention was to explain consciousness as the emergent product of the interaction among c- stituents having physical and neural character. The goal of this book is to explain how various types of complexity emerge due to the interaction among constituents. There are many questions to be answered, how to understand, control, decompose, manage, predict the many-faced complexity. After tea- ing thissubjectforseveralyearsIfeelthatthe time hascome toputthe whole story together. The term “complex system” is a buzzword, but we certainly don’t have a single de?nition for it. There are several predominant features of compl- ity. Complex processes may show unpredictable behavior (which we still try to predict somehow), may lead to uncontrolled explosion (such in case of epilepsy, earthquake eruptions or stock market crashes). One of the char- teristic feature of simple systems is, that there is a single cause which implies a single e?ect. For large class of complex systems it is true that e?ects are fed back to modify causes. Biological cells belong to this class. Furthermore they are open to material, energetic and information ?ow by interaction with their environment, still they are organizationallyclosed units. Another aspect of complexity is the question how collective phenomena emerge by some se- organized mechanisms.},

Especially in developing countries with imperfect markets, firms can face difficulties accessing external financing sources; however, family-owned firms might have some advantages in this regard over nonfamily firms. Unlike previous studies, this study considered that, in the Turkish context, nonfamily firms are financially constrained while family firms are not. To examine this hypothesis, we used the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to analyze panel data from 2006 to 2017. The findings showed that financing constraints were a significant obstacle to growth for nonfamily-owned manufacturing firms while the effect was not present for family firms since they are controlled by large, well-established family groups. These results elucidate the relationship between corporate ownership and growth among Turkish firms, especially those with strong links to large family-owned corporations. The results also revealed that reputation and network may facilitate easier access to external financing sources, especially when considering the “Big Six” family ties of firms.},

  abstract = {Innovation is often seen as carried out by highly educated labor in R\&D intensive companies with strong ties to leading centers of excellence in the scientific world. Seen from this angle innovation is a typical “first world” activity. There is, however, another way to look at innovation that goes significantly beyond this high-tech picture. In this broader perspective, innovation—the attempt to try out new or improved products, processes, or ways to do things—is an aspect of most if not all economic activities. In this sense, Section 1 puts forward the idea that innovation may be as relevant in the developing part of the world as elsewhere. Section 2 discusses the existing theoretical and empirical literature on the subject. An important conclusion is that to be able to exploit technology to their own advantage, developing countries need to develop the necessary capabilities for doing so. But what are these capabilities and how can they be measured? Section 3 surveys attempts to identify and measure capabilities at the national level. However, the development of such capabilities, it is argued, depends in important ways on what firms do. Section 4, therefore, focuses on recent attempts to survey innovation activity in firms in developing countries and what can be learnt from that. Section 5 discusses the role of domestic versus foreign sources in fostering innovation in the developing part of the world. The final section summarizes the main lessons.},

Yet, much of what IB scholars study is inherently configurational: various explanatory factors and their interplay simultaneously determine the outcome(s) studied, such as governance choice or firm-level performance. The mismatch between the nature of the empirical phenomena studied on the one hand, and hypothesis formulation and empirical methods deployed on the other, explains why many quantitative empirical studies in IB are overly reductionist, relying on hypotheses that assume linear (or simple, curvilinear), unifinal, and symmetrical effects. In this Editorial, we introduce IB scholars to contemporary configurational thinking and its analytical tool, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). We discuss this tool’s main tenets, advantages, and disadvantages. We review the limited prior IB research using this approach and present a wide range of IB phenomena where it could be usefully applied. We propose that contemporary configurational thinking and fsQCA can help scholars produce insights more closely aligned with the complex realities of international business than conventional research approaches.},

MSEs play a pivotal role in generating employment in these countries, yet the productivity of MSEs is relatively low. Little is known about how blackouts affect performance of MSEs. This paper is the first study to estimate the impact of such power blackouts on productivity of manufacturing MSEs and to discuss the role of the government in addressing the problem. We employed a pseudo-panel dataset covering six firm cohorts within 21 regions the Indonesian national electricity company operates in from 2010 to 2015. Our identification strategy firstly involved examining blackouts determinants and then using these determinants as instruments in an instrumental variable (IV) dynamic panel fixed effects estimation while controlling for factors that potentially affected productivity and correlated with blackouts. We found that electricity blackouts reduced average labor productivity and the resultant losses amounted to approximately IDR 71.5 billion (USD 4.91 million) per year in Indonesia. Therefore, it is crucial to improve electricity supply reliability in developing countries. We found that introducing a captive generator as a way to cope with power outages is positively associated with productivity, and that MSEs that have captive generators benefit when the power supply is poor. Our findings will assist policy makers to prioritize addressing power blackouts relative to other constraints MSEs face.},

  abstract = {The Way Forward for Entrepreneurship Around the World We are in the midst of a startup revolution. The growth and proliferation of innovation-driven startup activity is profound, unprecedented, and global in scope. Today, it is understood that communities of support and knowledge-sharing go along with other resources. The importance of collaboration and a long-term commitment has gained wider acceptance. These principles are adopted in many startup communities throughout the world. And yet, much more work is needed. Startup activity is highly concentrated in large cities. Governments and other actors such as large corporations and universities are not collaborating with each other nor with entrepreneurs as well as they could. Too often, these actors try to control activity or impose their view from the top-down, rather than supporting an environment that is led from the bottom-up. We continue to see a disconnect between an entrepreneurial mindset and that of many actors who wish to engage with and support entrepreneurship. There are structural reasons for this, but we can overcome many of these obstacles with appropriate focus and sustained practice. No one tells this story better than Brad Feld and Ian Hathaway. The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem explores what makes startup communities thrive and how to improve collaboration in these rapidly evolving, complex environments. The Startup Community Way is an explanatory guide for startup communities. Rooted in the theory of complex systems, this book establishes the systemic properties of entrepreneurial ecosystems and explains why their complex nature leads people to make predictable mistakes. As complex systems, value creation occurs in startup communities primarily through the interaction of the "parts" - the people, organizations, resources, and conditions involved - not the parts themselves. This continual process of bottom-up interactions unfolds naturally, producing value in novel and unexpected ways. Through these complex, emergent processes, the whole becomes greater and substantially different than what the parts alone could produce. Because of this, participants must take a fundamentally different approach than is common in much of our civic and professional lives. Participants must take a whole-system view, rather than simply trying to optimize their individual part. They must prioritize experimentation and learning over planning and execution. Complex systems are uncertain and unpredictable. They cannot be controlled, only guided and influenced. Each startup community is unique. Replication is enticing but impossible.

To do so, we build a synthetic indicator of financial constraints using an a priori classification based on specific firm characteristics and measures of financial pressure, and we embed it into a production equation, which controls for the endogenous relation between labour decisions and productivity innovations. We find a negative and significant estimate for the elasticity of total factor productivity with financial constraints of −18\%. This effect significantly amplifies in small, young, and private companies, it is likely to persist over time, and it increased during the recent financial crisis. A counterfactual exercise shows that peripheral countries are likely to gain between 19\% and 22\% of their average total factor productivity from free access to finance. Results are robust to several robustness checks.},

There is a strong tendency to understand entrepreneurship as technology, self-employment, new ideas, innovation, or wealth creation. We can thus expect more developed countries to show higher growth rates, given the importance of firms' development for economic and social growth. For this reason, it is important to determine the conditions that have the greatest influence on entrepreneurship dynamics at the macroeconomic level. Using firm birth and death rates (related to business dynamics and entrepreneurship), we focus on the European Union and use qualitative comparative analysis techniques to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for business dynamics. After dividing the whole EU sample into cohesion and non-cohesion countries, we find that entrepreneurship in cohesion countries is driven by necessity, while in non-cohesion countries, it is driven by opportunity.},

However, merely stating that access to finance is an obstacle does not necessarily imply the firm is financially constrained. We examine the idea that firms facing external finance constraints should in theory reinvest profits more heavily, as some canonical models in financial economics predict. We test this prediction using global firm surveys from 2006 to 2019. We do not find such higher profit reinvestment among firms that state finance is their most important obstacle. This puzzling null finding is robust to alternative measures of profit reinvestment and many alternative confounders. In contrast to stated constraints, profit reinvestment is in fact higher for non-stated measures of financial constraints (e.g. younger or smaller firms, as well as firms in sectors with fewer tangible assets). Overall, our findings suggest that these self-assessments of a main obstacle might be due to other reasons, beyond access to funds that finance capital investment.},

The book also describes models for categorical dependent variables in both single-level and multilevel data.The third edition of the book includes several new topics that were not present in the second edition. Specifically, a new chapter has been included, focussing on fitting multilevel latent variable modeling in the R environment. With R, it is possible to fit a variety of latent variable models in the multilevel context, including factor analysis, structural models, item response theory, and latent class models. The third edition also includes new sections in Chapter 11 describing two useful alternatives to standard multilevel models, fixed effects models and generalized estimating equations. These approaches are particularly useful with small samples and when the researcher is interested in modeling the correlation structure within higher-level units (e.g., schools). The third edition also includes a new section on mediation modeling in the multilevel context, in Chapter 11.This thoroughly updated revision gives the reader state-of-the-art tools to launch their own investigations in multilevel modeling and gain insight into their research.},

This chapter, which is mainly based on Forrest et al.

Different from some of the known hypotheses and/or conclusions in the literature, this chapter shows, among other results, that for an individual no matter how he prefers one consumption over another, (1) there are incomparable consumptions, (2) his consumption preferences may not be transitive, and (3) his indifference relation of consumptions in practice may not be transitive. Although these results have been confirmed by different authors with varied settings, our confirmations are based purely on analytical analysis without making use of any auxiliary concepts. More importantly, this chapter generalizes the classical conclusion of Debreu (Theory of value: An axiomatic analysis of economic equilibrium, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1959) on when a continuous utility representation exists in a very different way from these published recently by Efe Ok and his colleagues.

Based on a minimal level of intuition and common knowledge, four axioms are adopted as the starting points for deriving consequent conclusions. It then explains why other commonly employed assumptions should be abandoned. On the backdrop of a set-theoretic setup, the concepts of production and profit functions are investigated innovatively so that unnecessary assumptions, widely appearing in the current microeconomic theory, can be naturally avoided. Other than generalizing several known results in producer theory, such as Hotelling’s lemma, examples are introduced to show that these known results are not universally true when different systems of values and beliefs are considered.

In particular, by using counterexamples it is demonstrated that the optimal production correspondence is not generally homogeneous of degree zero.

We use a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to critically explore the policy implications of women’s entrepreneurship research according to gender perspective: feminist empiricism, feminist standpoint theory, and post-structuralist feminist theory. Our research question asks whether there is a link between the nature of policy implications and the different theoretical perspectives adopted, and whether scholars’ policy implications have changed as the field of women’s entrepreneurship research has developed. We concentrate on empirical studies published in the “Big Five” primary entrepreneurship research journals (SBE, ETP, JBV, JSBM, and ERD) over a period of more than 30~years (1983–2015). We find that policy implications from women’s entrepreneurship research are mostly vague, conservative, and center on identifying skills gaps in women entrepreneurs that need to be “fixed,” thus isolating and individualizing any perceived problem. Despite an increase in the number of articles offering policy implications, we find little variance in the types of policy implications being offered by scholars, regardless of the particular theoretical perspective adopted, and no notable change over our 30-year review period. Recommendations to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem for women from a policy perspective are offered, and avenues for future research are identified.},

We explore how the most economic of human behaviours, entrepreneurship, came to be largely excluded from mainstream economic theory. In contrast, we report that evolutionary economists have acknowledged the importance of understanding emergence and we explore the advances that have been made in this regard. We go on to argue that evolutionary economics can make further progress by taking a more ‘naturalistic’ approach to economic evolution. This requires that economic analysis be fully embedded in complex economic system theory and that associated understandings as to how humans react to states of uncertainty be explicitly dealt with. We argue that ‘knowledge,’ because of the existence of uncertainty is, to a large degree ‘conjectural’ and, thus, is closely linked to our emotional states. Our economic behaviour is also influenced by the reality that we, and the systems that we create, are dissipative structures. Thus, we introduce the notions of ‘energy gradients’ and ‘knowledge gradients’ as essential concepts in understanding economic emergence and resultant economic growth.},

It is argued that models of economic growth should be built from innovation diffusion processes, unfolding in history, rather than from a timeless aggregate production function. A simple ‘evolutionary macroeconomic’ model of economic growth is developed and tested using almost two centuries of British data. The empirical findings strongly support the hypothesis that growth has been due to the presence of a ‘super-radical innovation diffusion process’ following the industrial deployment of fossil fuels on a large scale in the 19th Century. Also, the evidence suggests that large and sustained movements in energy prices have had a very significant long term role to play.},

  abstract = {In this article, the goal is to offer a new research agenda for evolutionary macroeconomics. The article commences with a broad review of the main ideas in the history of thought concerning the determinants of economic growth and an introduction to the evolutionary perspective. This is followed by a selective review of recent evolutionary approaches to macroeconomics. These approaches are found to be somewhat disconnected. It is argued that the 'micro-meso-macro' approach to economic evolution is capable of resolving this problem by offering an analytical framework in which macroeconomics can be built upon 'meso-foundations', not micro-foundations, as asserted in the mainstream. It is also stressed that the economic system and its components are complex adaptive systems and that this complexity must not be assumed away through the imposition of simplistic assumptions made for analytical convenience. It is explained that complex economic systems are, at base, energetic in character but differ from biological complex systems in the way that they collect, store and apply knowledge. It is argued that a focus upon stocks and flows of energy and knowledge in complex economic systems can yield an appropriate analytical framework for macroeconomics. It is explained how such a framework can be connected with key insights of both Schumpeter and Keynes that have been eliminated in modern macroeconomics. A macroeconomic framework that cannot be operationalized empirically is of limited usefulness so, in the last part of the article, an appropriate methodology for evolutionary macroeconomics is discussed. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Thus, this study employs a configurational approach, using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fs/QCA), to analyze the constellations of different strategic orientations, strategy types, and market conditions that yield superior performance. The study finds no evidence of high-performing configurations without customer orientation and shows that highly performing firms configure themselves around their customer orientation in three different ways.

It is claimed that one aspect which distinguishes the EE perspective from other perspectives related to business environments is its systemic approach; however, much of the systemic approach still needs to be investigated. The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate how the systemic and complex approach of EEs can be theoretically strengthened. We do this by investigating what values complex adaptive system theory holds for advancing the EE perspective. We highlight four propositions which are of particular importance for strengthening the systemic approach of EE: spatial and component boundaries of the system; self-governance; the relational dimension between system components and the system; and the evolution of the system. We propose that boundaries should be seen as a natural part of the system, that a complex system is too complex to capture all components and all interactions, and that studying only individual activities will not enable us to fully understand the system’s behaviour.},

  abstract = {Using a unique firm-level dataset for the manufacturing sector in Indonesia, we examine how firms’ political connections affect their access to finance and performance. We determine individual firm's political connections by identifying whether the government owns shares in the firm, whether politicians are on its board of directors, and whether highly-ranked managers personally know any politician. Although several studies have examined effects of political connections on firms financing and performance, we contribute to the literature by distinguishing between large firms and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), between the loan approval and amount setting processes, and between formal and informal political connections. We find that politically connected firms are more likely to be able to borrow from state-owned banks. Moreover, being connected to the government raises the probability that a firm can receive the full loan amount it applied for. The improvement in access to finance from political connections is more prominent for SMEs than for large firms. Furthermore, such improvement mostly comes from personal connections with politicians rather than more formal connections measured by the government ownership or politicians on the board of directors. Finally, we examine the effect of political connected lending on allocative efficiency of capital and find weak evidence that scarce financial resources are likely channeled by state-owned banks to politically connected but less productive firms.},

We therefore build upon those papers by introducing an understanding of EE as a multilayer network from the perspective of complexity theory. Building upon this understanding, we provide a representative example to illustrate the practical application of our conceptual model via agent-based modeling while outlining a research agenda that suggests new directions for future studies in this field.},

The staggered launch of special economic zones, which we link to positive shocks to the business environment on both the demand and supply side, leads to significantly increased employment in micro- and small enterprises (MSEs) located in these special economic zones (SEZs), compared to enterprises in contextually similar districts that are unexposed to an SEZ. Key channels explaining the improved growth outcomes include expanded access to external markets for the enterprises’ goods and services, more dynamic labor environments, and improved credit terms and conditions. To broaden the relevance of our findings, we combine data from prominent empirical studies on microfinance and demonstrate how related business conditions identified in the enterprise growth literature help explain differences in client business outcomes found in their results. Policy implications are that a smaller but influential segment of microfinance borrowers significantly benefit from opportunities provided by improved local business environments and that governments and lenders can play active roles in facilitating the necessary improvements for such MSEs.},

Yet, theorizing about causal complexity can prove challenging for the correlational theorizing that is predominant in the field of management, given its “net effects thinking” that emphasizes the unique contribution of individual explanatory factors. In contrast, configurational theories and thinking are well suited to explaining causally complex phenomena. In this article, we seek to advance configurational theorizing by providing a model of the configurational theorizing process, which consists of three iterative stages—scoping, linking and naming. In each stage, we develop and offer several heuristics aimed at stimulating configurational theorizing. That is, these theorizing heuristics are intended to help scholars discover configurations of explanatory factors, probe the connections among these factors, and articulate the orchestrating themes that underpin their coherence. We conclude with a discussion of how configurational theorizing advances theory development in the field of management and organizations, and beyond.},

The dimensions of national culture also play an important role. Our results show that individualism, masculinity, and long-term orientation have a positive impact on profitability, whereas power distance and uncertainty avoidance have the opposite effect.

First, we tried to identify the main determinants that may explain the consumption of residential water in Tunisia using the pseudo panel method.

Moreover, the comparison between the obtained results using this method and those calculated based on the cross-sectional data showed the robustness of the pseudo-panel estimators. In the second step, our goal examined the policies and strategic orientations that seemed to be useful to manage water consumption in Tunisia. Estimation results reveal that the income elasticity of Tunisian residential demand for water is of about 1.18\% and price elasticity is around 0.34 confirming that residential water demand in Tunisia is inelastic. This analysis consolidates the assumptions highlighting a coupling between Economic Status and drinking water consumption, the synergy between the equipment rate and water demand, and the synergy between the type of housing structure and the drinking water demand. In addition, it also emphasized the coupling between the socio-professional category of the household head and water consumption, the coupling between household size and water consumption, and the classical economic assumption confirming that price elasticity is negative.},

  abstract = {This paper looks at the effects of demand uncertainty and stagnancy on firms’ decisions to engage in R\&amp;D activities and the amount of financial effort devoted to these. The paper provides a number of contributions to the innovation literature: first, it adds to the revived debate on demand-pull perspectives in innovation studies by examining demand-related (lack of) incentives to invest in innovation. Second, it complements the literature on barriers to innovation by focusing on demand-related obstacles rather than the more frequently explored financial barriers. Third, it analyses whether experiencing demand barriers is a sector-specific feature. Firms active in high- or low-tech manufacturing or in knowledge-intensive or low-tech services might be more or less dependent on demand conditions when deciding to perform R\&amp;D. We find that uncertain demand and lack of demand are perceived as two quite distinct barriers. While the perception of a lack of demand has a marked negative impact not only on the amount of investment in R\&amp;D but also the likelihood of firms to engage in R\&amp;D activities, demand uncertainty seems, on the contrary, to represent an incentive to spend more in R\&amp;D, although only in low-tech sectors. We interpret this evidence in terms of the specific phase of the innovation cycle in which decisions to invest in R\&amp;D are taken. Sectoral affiliation seems to be playing a role only for demand uncertainty, supporting the conjecture that positive expectations on the presence of adequate market demand are a necessary condition to invest in R\&amp;D.},

  abstract = {Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001–2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought.},

It examines whether female board representation is associated with greater climate change innovation and whether its effect is determined by the presence of a greater number of independent female directors or the existence of a critical mass of female directors. The results obtained for a panel data of 3,928 companies over the period 2010–2020 (35,199 observations) confirm that companies with a greater female board representation (both in number and in percentage) are more proactive in terms of investments in climate change innovation. This positive effect does not require a critical mass of female directors and diminishes when the percentage of female directors is higher than 46.78\%, a proportion associated with the presence of five or more female directors. Furthermore, female directors influence climate change innovation mainly through their involvement in management as executive directors, rather than through the monitoring and advisory roles that characterize independent directors. The theoretical and practical implications derived from this research are robust to different considerations and methodological approaches.},

Using a vector error correction model alongside quadratic and piecewise regression equations produced results estimating bidirectional causality. However, the impact of profitability on business growth, measured from employment, was positive and stronger than the impact of business growth on profitability. Meanwhile, using net sales as a growth factor indicated a negative impact. Thus, the findings confirmed the predictions of both evolutionary and managerialism theories. Although not specifically targeted at the firm level, this research does provide insight into the efficiency and profitability conditions that prevail within Mexican entrepreneurship. The paper's conclusions highlight a strong profitability-growth link in sectors shaped by smaller firms, suggesting suitable conditions for investment, competition, economic growth, and quality improvement.},

This means that size differences between firms are transitory. Another, more natural way to explore the long-run distribution of firm sizes is to examine data on the growth of particular firms over long periods of time. Using a sample of 147 UK firms observed continually for more than 30 years, our conclusions are that growth rates are highly variable over time and that differences in growth rates between firms do not persist for very long. Further, firms show no tendency to converge to either a common size or to a pattern of stable size differences over time. These results are compared and contrasted with standard approaches that suggest that firms reach and maintain stable positions in a skewed size distribution.}

To achieve our objective, we utilize the context of customer engagement and explore how both methodological approaches can explain the factors that lead customers to engage with brands/firms. We test the association between customer engagement and its antecedents by using both methods, fsQCA and multiple regression analysis (MRA), and compare the findings. MRA results show a significant relationship between customer engagement and perceived interactivity, perceived identification, perceived value, and brand involvement, a negative relationship with perceived fairness, while the relationship with customer satisfaction and perceived value is not statistically significant. On the other hand, fsQCA revealed eight different combinations of these antecedents that lead to high levels of customer engagement. Although multiple regression analysis (MRA) certainly has its own merit, our findings indicate that this methodological approach does not capture the complexities extant in real life. This method's strength of providing generalizable results is also its weakness as relationships cannot always be generalized as shown in our study. As such, at a minimum, fsQCA should be used as a complementary approach when authors employ MRA. We suggest ‘at a minimum’ because fsQCA possesses sufficient explanatory power to be employed by itself to offer a rich perspective on the relationships of interest. We also make several noteworthy contributions to the customer engagement and service marketing literatures.},

  abstract = {A Dissertation Guide for Professional Learners Doctoral education has changed dramatically over the last three decades. Traditionally, pursuit of a doctoral or research credential involved intense study at a large, traditional research university, and was reserved for those seeking careers in academia or research. The process of completing doctoral level work at traditional universities usually required a commitment to full time study, varied tremendously between institutions, and was often somewhat mysterious. Today, all this has changed. The emergence and growth of online education has led to a proliferation of doctoral learning possibilities for busy professionals. Individuals in the industry, nonprofit, and education are sectors are pursuing doctoral study as a means to advance their careers, increase their market value in the workplace, and establish their professional stature. If this sounds like you, then you have come to the right place. Recipes for Success is the book that will launch you on a successful quest for the doctoral degree. Dissertations are very personal endeavors and accomplishments, originating with problems and issues that are meaningful and important to the doctoral learner. These professionals are deeply grounded in their understanding of the issues and needs of their profession. Recipes build on this this understanding, helping learners to discover and frame issues they are passionate about, and construct a credible and influential research study around this passion. While most dissertation guides focus largely or exclusively on the mechanics of writing and organization, Recipes approaches dissertation development as an iterative process of thinking and self-reflection that leads learners to discover what matters most to them and to their professions, and enables them to frame this meaning into a research problem and purpose, and to organize and execute a study design to fit, and thus solve the problem and achieve the purpose. From the very beginning of your doctoral journey to the ultimate achievement of degree completion, this book is your guide to the process and content of dissertation and research creation. In Recipes for Success, we articulate a process by which you can build the pieces of a successful and influential dissertation. Using a workbook approach rich in tools, templates, frameworks, examples, web integration, and hard-won lessons from experience, Recipes provides a friendly, easy to navigate process crafting issues and ideas into research and results. Based on our 40+ years of collective experience in the online educational setting, mentoring over 300 professional learners to success in completing their doctorates (including numerous award winners), we identify the most important factors for success and the traps to avoid. Whether you are considering doctoral study, are already in a doctoral program, or are working to develop and complete your dissertation, you will find Recipes for Success a key ingredient in your success as a doctoral learner. Our graduates tell us that Recipes is THE book that made a difference in their doctoral career and success. YOU can do it too! Good luck on your doctoral journey!},

  abstract = {Startups are crucial job creators and drivers of economic growth. Research on startups has predominantly targeted high-growth startups, while a comprehensive understanding of alternative growth journeys remains limited. Addressing this gap, we employ the theory of early firm growth and the time-calibrated theory of entrepreneurial action to examine 416 biotech startups. We use time series cluster analysis to unveil four heterogeneous new venture growth trajectories. These are characterized by unique timings, paces, and sequences of financial, human, and innovative resource-related activities. This study contributes to new venture growth research, particularly in science-based high-tech startups, with its nuanced understanding of diverse growth pathways, including intriguing notions of early failure, growth reversal, and high and moderate steady growth.},

We begin by arguing that the primitive levels of investigation, where the action is, are those which concern knowledge and organizational procedures while in most respects the I/O representation is just an ex post, derived, one. Next, we outline what we consider to be important advances in the understanding of productive knowledge and of the nature and behaviors of business organizations which to a good extent embody such a knowledge. Finally, we explore some implications of such procedural view of technologies in terms of input-output relations (of which standard production functions are a particular instantiation). We do that with the help of some pieces of evidence, drawing both upon incumbent literature and our own elaboration on micro longitudinal data on the Italian industry.},

They started out as tools for testing hypotheses about the workings of marginal-productivity theory and the competitiveness of labor markets, using macroeconomic data. After a number of withering attacks by critics, this line of work shifted from macroeconomic data to microeconomic data, especially in agriculture (e.g.,Tintner, 1944; Mundlak, 1961; Heady and Dillon, 1961), where the assumptions necessary for estimating something sensible appeared to be more plausible. The increasing interest in growth and technological change brought production functions back as a measurement framework for productivity at the macroeconomic level. An important “dual” literature on cost functions, factor-demand systems, and flexible functional forms emerged somewhat later, but we shall comment on it only in passing here; see Jorgenson (1986) for a review. Both approaches have undergone significant econometric questioning, focused primarily on whether or not the relationship of interest has really been identified or is even identifiable with the data at hand.},

We examine two main research questions. First, do persistent innovators grow more than other firms? Second, do persistent innovators show more persistent growth patterns over time compared to other firms? We find negative answers to both questions: firms that persistently innovate over the first decade, do not grow more and do not display more persistent growth dynamics in the succeeding years, regardless of whether innovation persistence is defined in terms of R\&D, patenting activity, or product or process innovation. These findings lend support to luck and random theories of firm growth, in turn challenging innovation persistence theories commonly suggesting that persistent innovators enjoy large and sustained comparative advantages.},

This growth has been driven by the rise of better-educated baby-boom cohorts. A growth accounting exercise shows that human capital contributes significantly to economic growth; it accounted for 0.5\% points of annual GDP growth over the period. Human capital is projected to remain a major growth factor over the next two decades as the increase in educational attainment continues. Increased employment rate of elderly or female workers reduces the aggregate human capital growth while increasing the available labor.

For the period from 2009 to 2013, we combine firm-level data covering more than 40,000 firms from the Vietnam Enterprise Survey with province-level data from the Vietnam Provincial Competitiveness Indicators. Our estimation strategy builds upon a novel copula-based estimator that accounts for potential endogeneity biases without requiring external instruments. Our results show that financial development and a favourable business environment generally promote firm growth, but some components of the business environment, such as low entry costs, access to land and business service support, foster firm growth more strongly than financial development. Most importantly, financial development and the business environment interact positively in their effects on firm growth. The impact of local financial development on firm growth is higher in provinces with a competitive business environment. Conversely, improvements in provincial competitiveness have a greater impact on firm growth in provinces with a more developed financial sector. The results clearly show that policies to promote local financial development need to be coordinated with measures to improve the broader business environment.},

The growth of small enterprises in agriculture, trade, services, and construction, with microenterprises constituting the bulk of SMEs, has been the engine of growth and contributed to the long term recovery of Albanian economy. However, the growth of SMEs has been hampered by a variety of barriers erected, directly or indirectly, by the state. Fiscal constraints particularly high rate of taxes and contributions, financial constraints and the institutional environment have been some of the major barriers they have had to surmount. These barriers have encouraged many firms to conduct some or all of their activities in the informal sector of the economy. The survey of fifty SMEs established since 1992 highlights the difficulties faced by these enterprises in the environment of early transition. The econometric evidence confirms the role of financial barriers to SME growth, especially when they are combined with the poor institutional environment. The results show that the government has to embark on SME policies designed to disseminate the information on support programmes widely, and to speed up the reform of the financial system, legal framework and law enforcement.},

In contrast, the enhancing effect of stock market deepening on innovation requires a lower level of political democracy. Further, we find that increasing the state's openness and competitiveness in the executive recruitment of leaders is the main channel through which political democratization promotes the role of banking and stock markets for financing innovation. Our results are robust to the use of the instrumental variable approach; alternative measures for financial deepening, democracy and innovation input; long-differenced variables; and alternative specifications.},

  abstract = {Poverty is a multidimensional concept often comprising a monetary outcome and other welfare dimensions such as education, subjective well-being or health that are measured on an ordinal scale. In applied research, multidimensional poverty is ubiquitously assessed by studying each poverty dimension independently in univariate regression models or by combining several poverty dimensions into a scalar index. This approach inhibits a thorough analysis of the potentially varying interdependence between the poverty dimensions. We propose a multivariate copula generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (copula GAMLSS or distributional copula model) to tackle this challenge. By relating the copula parameter to covariates, we specifically examine if certain factors determine the dependence between poverty dimensions. Furthermore, specifying the full conditional bivariate distribution allows us to derive several features such as poverty risks and dependence measures coherently from one model for different individuals. We demonstrate the approach by studying two important poverty dimensions: income and education. Since the level of education is measured on an ordinal scale while income is continuous, we extend the bivariate copula GAMLSS to the case of mixed ordered-continuous outcomes. The new model is integrated into the GJRM package in R and applied to data from Indonesia. Particular emphasis is given to the spatial variation of the income–education dependence and groups of individuals at risk of being simultaneously poor in both education and income dimensions.},

  abstract = {The paper describes a project undertaken within the Economic and Social Research Council's ‘Competitiveness of British Industry’ research programme. The aim of the project was to assist agencies who intervene in a local economy to try to help individual small firms. Guidance currently available to such agencies was considered to lack an adequate theoretical basis in relation to either the choice of firms who should be granted assistance, or the form of assistance which might be given. In particular, there is a lack of recognition that there is scope for management strategy among smaller firms, affecting the way they compete in the market place and having a clear bearing on their revealed performance. From a study of 100 small firms located in Telford New Town criteria were derived for classifying the ‘competitive stance’ of small firms. This was identified as the key to the potential performance of the small firm. The extent to which it reveals a potential for future growth can determine whether a firm is or not a suitable candidate for assistance. And the strengths and weakness in an individual firm's stance can determine the most suitable form of assistance to give. The survey and analysis exercise leading to the identification of components of competitive stance are described, and the classification of firms into a range of stance types. Then the usefulness of the competitive stance classification as a guide to selection of firms and choice of form of assistance is considered.},

  abstract = {In the 1990s, growth theory has incorporated imperfect competition in its investigations. This innovation has proven to be seminal: Cleviating from growth models with perfect competition, the new framework featured forward looking entrepreneurs. Firms maximize profits intertemporarily, i. e. their in vestment leads to instantaneous sunk costs and offers flows of future profits. Firms finance this investment by launching shares. The capital market is per fectly competitive, implying that the return on a share is equal to the return on a bond. As opposed to the capital market, the goods market is imperfectly competitive. As a result of investment, firms enjoy market power. That is, firms may acquire the capability to provide a product that is differentiated in, e. g. , styling, technology, accessibility, or reputation. The launch of a dif ferentiated product allows to capture a market niche, and successful firms may price above marginal cost. The resulting profit flows are channelled to the firms' shareholders. The introduction of monopolistic competition into growth theory is valuable: real world economies may be portrayed rather by such an imperfect competition framework than by a perfect competition approach. Starting with Romer (1990), in growth theory, modeling of imperfect competition has been notoriously bound to a focus on the impact of research and development (R\&D) on economic growth. In the existing literature, growth-affecting investment is restricted to R\&D investment.},

The study transcends variable and case-level analyses to go beyond prior statistical findings of small-to-medium effect sizes of happiness–performance relationships; the study here identifies antecedent paths involving high-versus-low happy employees associating with high-versus-low managers’ assessments of these employees’ performances. Design/methodology/approach The study merges data from surveys of employees (n = 247) and surveys completed by their managers (n = 43) and by using qualitative comparative analysis via the software program, fsQCA.com. The study analyzes data from Janfusan Fancyworld, the largest (in revenues and number of employees) tourism business group in Taiwan; Janfusan Fancyworld includes tourist hotels, amusement parks, restaurants and additional firms in related service sectors. Findings The findings support the four tenets of configural analysis and theory construction: recognize equifinality of different solutions for the same outcome, test for asymmetric solutions, test for causal asymmetric outcomes for very high versus very low happiness and work performance and embrace complexity. Research limitations/implications Additional research in other firms and additional countries is necessary to confirm the usefulness of examining algorithms for predicting very high (low) happiness and very high (low) quality of work performance. The implications are substantial that configural theory and research will resolve perplexing happiness–performance conundrums. Practical implications The study provides useful case-level algorithms involving employees’ demographic characteristics and their assessments of work facet-specifics which are useful for explaining very high happiness-at-work and high quality of work performance (as assessed by managers) – as well as algorithms explaining very low happiness and very low quality of work performance. Originality/value The study is the first to propose and test the tenets of configural theory in the context of hospitality frontline service employees’ happiness-at-work and managers’ assessments of these employees’ quality of work performances.},

The relationship between wealth and entry into entrepreneurship is essentially flat over the majority of the wealth distribution. It is only at the top of the wealth distribution—after the ninety‐fifth percentile—that a positive relationship can be found. Segmenting businesses into industries with high– and low–starting capital requirements, we find no evidence that wealth matters more for businesses requiring higher initial capital. When using inheritances as an instrument for wealth, we find that both past and future inheritances predict current business entry, showing that inheritances capture more than simply liquidity. We further exploit the regional variation in house prices and find that households that lived in regions in which housing prices appreciated strongly were no more likely to start a business than households in other regions.}

In addition, we con-sider the role of financial development, credit information availability, credit cycle, business cycle, and macroprudential policies. We calculate the credit-constrained status of SMEs using information from the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey (WBES). The findings suggest that the likelihood of a business being credit-constrained is smaller in a competitive banking environment. We get consistent results when employing various indicators of credit constraints and banking competition. The availability of credit information reduces the information asymmetry and lowers the discouraging role of banking market power. Furthermore, banking sector development supports the competition in decreasing SMEs’ financing obstacles. In addition, economies with more financial freedom, effective enforcement of legal rights, and institutional quality support businesses in gaining more access to external financing. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {Leveraging the power of business networks for success. Whether it sells computers, clothing, or cars, your firm's fate is increasingly linked to that of many other firms, all of which must collaborate effectively in order for each to thrive. This phenomenon has changed the basis of competition from battle between firms to battles between networks of firms--and more than ever before, success depends on managing assets your company doesn't own. In The Keystone Advantage, Marco Iansiti and Roy Levien offer a new lens for understanding how these ubiquitous and complex business networks behave and explore the implications for strategy formulation, innovation, and operations management. Iansiti and Levien argue that biological ecosystems provide a powerful analogy to the functioning of business networks. Just as "keystone species" in nature play central roles in their ecosystems, companies such as Walmart, Microsoft, and Li \& Fung deploy "keystone strategies" to actively shape and regulate the workings of their business ecosystems--dramatically improving their own performance in the process. Iansiti and Levien argue that the best keystones simplify the challenge of connecting a very large and distributed network of companies to their customers and provide "platforms" that other firms can leverage to increase productivity, enhance stability, and spur innovation. Drawing from more than ten years of research and practical experience across a range of industries, the authors identify three specific roles that firms play within business ecosystems: keystone, dominator, and niche. The book lays out a framework any firm can use to assess the characteristics of its own ecosystem, reevaluate its technology and operations strategy, and formulate specific tactics for gaining sustainable competitive advantage. Practical and insightful, The Keystone Advantage will help leaders, managers, and policy makers to understand, analyze, and successful execute strategy in today's networked environments.},

  abstract = {Inadequate infrastructure impedes the productivity of manufacturing firms, with negative consequences for the wider economy. This study examines how water infrastructure copes with severe weather fluctuations and analyzes the effect of unreliable water supplies on the productivity of manufacturing firms, focusing predominately on firms in developing economies. This is achieved using firm-level data from World Bank Enterprise Surveys covering over 16,000 manufacturing firms in a cross-section of 103 countries. The study finds that periods of significantly low rainfall lead to higher water outages. The overall impact is driven by the effects of drought on less-developed economies, with economies at higher levels of income benefitting from more resilient water infrastructure. Furthermore, we find that incidents of water outages lead to lower firm productivity for firms in less-developed economies. For the average firm located in a low or lower-middle income economy, one additional water outage incident per day in a typical month can lead to losses of approximately 8.2\% of annual sales. This calls for increased policy focus on water infrastructure services, particularly in poorer countries where water infrastructure and firms seem to be particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of rainfall.},

  abstract = {This study uncovers a gender labor productivity gap among informal firms in 14 developing economies. The mean labor productivity of women-owned informal firms is approximately 15.6 percent (0.17 log points) lower than that of men-owned informal firms. The difference in productivity is larger at the lower quantiles of the labor productivity distribution than at the higher quantiles. The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder and quantile decomposition methods are used to estimate the aggregate “endowment” vs “structural” effects, and individual factors’ contribution to the productivity gap. Several policy-relevant findings are revealed. First, the labor productivity gap at the mean is significantly larger due to lower education, prior work experience, capitalization, and less protection from crime among women than men owners of informal firms. The smaller size of the women-owned firms and their higher return from operations under contracts narrow the mean productivity gap. Second, the productivity gap at the mean and different labor productivity quantiles can be substantially narrowed by providing more resources to women owners of informal firms, such as education, managerial experience, and physical capital, without improvements in their returns to women-owned informal businesses. Third, overall, there is evidence of “sticky floors” for women owners, but not “glass ceilings”. Fourth, there is heterogeneity in the contribution of individual factors to the productivity gap at different quantiles of the labor productivity distribution. Targeting policies to the relevant quantiles will improve their effectiveness. Fifth, there are important similarities and differences between groups of countries in low-income Africa, middle-income Africa, and Latin America, as far as the gender labor productivity gap and its drivers are concerned. Thus, an eclectic policy approach is needed, combining the broader findings of the literature with the prevailing local conditions. Last, the data do indicate that a majority of women- and men-owned informal businesses would like to formalize.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose a way of asking about organizational conceptions. Some years ago, Edgar Morin proposed the paradigm of complexity as the one that opposes to and contains both the mechanicist and the systemic paradigms, which he calls simplifiers. Based on these paradigms, some of their principles, as well as their influence in organizational thinking are studied here, looking for the establishment of a set of considerations to be taken into account when treating an organizational conception as complex. Design/methodology/approach – Ten paradigmatic principles were compared from the mechanicism, systemic and complexity viewpoints, considering how they were used in the organizational discourse. Findings – As a result, complex organizational conceptions consider the subject as active conscience in the world. In the same way, they establish dialogic relations among: the universal and the particular, temporal reversibility and irreversibility, the parts and the whole, linear and circular causality, order and disorder, organization and environment, observer and organization, and autonomy and dependence, through the use of the complex logic that allows adopting a meta‐point of view to articulate the contradictions and paying attention to the result of the dialogic processes pointed out. Research limitations/implications – The paper focuses especially on the dialogic principle, leaving the need to approach both the recursion and hologramatic principles, according to that proposed by Edgar Morin. Practical implications – The paper establishes some references which should contribute to the understanding of complex organizations, as human activity systems, beyond the objectivism of the so‐called “complex systems”. Originality/value – In this paper, a way of asking about organizational conceptions is proposed, with the aim of knowing the degree of satisfaction of paradigmatic requirements of complexity; so that, it allows knowing if what is being called complex – the organizations – is being treated in a complex way in turn.},

This paper aims at analyzing the difference in business obstacles faced by firms across sizes using a comprehensive survey data of 9281 Indian firms conducted under the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey. The results of the analysis of variance for business obstacles across the size of firms indicate a significant difference in the mean values on 9 parameters of business obstacles out of 15 parameters. The small and medium enterprises (SMEs) perceive a comparatively lower level of obstacles than large firms due to a number of supports and provisions for SMEs in the country. Access to resources for managing the business operations, competition, and availability of qualified manpower are the major areas of concern for SMEs. This study is helpful in designing appropriate policies for promoting business enterprises in a focused manner.},

  abstract = {Models have been extensively analysed in economic methodology, notably their degree of ability to provide explanations. This paper takes a complementary, comparative approach, examining theory development in the natural sciences. Examples show how diverse types of evidence combine with causal hypotheses to generate empirically based causal theories—a cumulative process occurring over a long timescale. Models are typically nested within this broader theory. This could be a good model for research in economics, providing a methodology that ensures good correspondence with the target system—especially as economics research is largely empirical, and has effective methods for causal inference. This paper analyses the key features of three successful theories in the natural sciences, and draws out some lessons that may be useful to economists. Some examples of good practice in economics are noted, e.g. involving money and banking, and the growth of the state. On the other hand, the widespread pre-crisis use of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models that ignored the financial sector raises the question, how to realise what has been omitted? Nesting models in an empirically based causal theory could solve this. Furthermore, some phenomena have clear explanations, but mainstream theory obscures them, as with the Lucas puzzle about the direction of international capital flows. And, the prevailing theories about capitalist growth do not explain the basic evidence on its temporal and spatial distribution. Economics could beneficially learn from the natural sciences.},

This cannot be the whole story, because entrepreneurship has a far more widespread historical and geographical distribution than these high-growth countries, and occurs particularly in rather stagnant societies; innovation contributes to economic growth, but it is unclear why it has become so much more prevalent in capitalist societies, or why it takes a form that is growth-promoting in that context. Thus, entrepreneurship and innovation only contribute to dynamism in a particular institutional context: a real economy that is dominated by capitalist firms, which are able to purchase all their inputs including labour, making it easy to change the technology, workforce, product, location, etc.},

He was clear that the continual transformation underlying economic growth is an intrinsic feature of the system, but left no clear causal account of the underlying process. His principal narrative concerned the entrepreneur, an “agency” explanation rather than a causal one in the usual sense. However, closer examination reveals that this does not fit with the observed historical pattern of continuing per capita growth, which is specific to the type of capitalist economy that has only existed in the past two centuries. He also introduced a more systemic view, but this is not very well developed in his writings and the causal mechanism is unclear. Connected with the ambiguity in respect of causation, Schumpeter was also unclear about the relative roles of large and small firms in innovation, at times seeing large corporations as the engine of growth, but at other times seeing them as a threat to the dynamism of the entrepreneur. Comparison with the historical record shows that neither view well represents the general process of capitalist transformation.},

Our theoretical framework, which is supported by an analysis of over 205,000 observations in 16 emerging countries in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region, explains why informal and formal institutions have a considerably different effect on the profitability of SMEs and large firms, and indicates that while SMEs benefit from formal institutional quality more than large firms do, large firms benefit from trust in society more than SMEs.

Our analysis of over 230,000 observations reveals that institutional reforms benefit domestic firms. Conversely, a completely different pattern emerges for foreign subsidiaries, indicating that institutional reforms have negative consequences for their profitability. Hence, in contrast to the established assumption that developed institutional environments are advantageous for foreign subsidiaries, the nature of institutional changes makes domestic firms the main beneficiaries.},

  abstract = {We propose a generic Bayesian framework for inference in distributional regression models in which each parameter of a potentially complex response distribution and not only the mean is related to a structured additive predictor. The latter is composed additively of a variety of different functional effect types such as nonlinear effects, spatial effects, random coefficients, interaction surfaces or other (possibly nonstandard) basis function representations. To enforce specific properties of the functional effects such as smoothness, informative multivariate Gaussian priors are assigned to the basis function coefficients. Inference can then be based on computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques where a generic procedure makes use of distribution-specific iteratively weighted least squares approximations to the full conditionals. The framework of distributional regression encompasses many special cases relevant for treating nonstandard response structures such as highly skewed nonnegative responses, overdispersed and zero-inflated counts or shares including the possibility for zero- and one-inflation. We discuss distributional regression along a study on determinants of labour incomes for full-time working males in Germany with a particular focus on regional differences after the German reunification. Controlling for age, education, work experience and local disparities, we estimate full conditional income distributions allowing us to study various distributional quantities such as moments, quantiles or inequality measures in a consistent manner in one joint model. Detailed guidance on practical aspects of model choice including the selection of several competing distributions for labour incomes and the consideration of different covariate effects on the income distribution complete the distributional regression analysis. We find that next to a lower expected income, full-time working men in East Germany also face a more unequal income distribution than men in the West, ceteris paribus.},

The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.}

  abstract = {Formalizing firms can potentially increase the tax base, expand safety and social protections for workers, create good jobs, and promote firm growth. However, the costs and processes of formality may be too challenging for some firms to bear. Thus, informal firms may not be able to survive the transition to formality, and attempts to expand formality through more intensive enforcement may be harmful and counterproductive to job creation and growth. This paper investigates the potential for currently informal firms to formalize in Egypt. The paper compares the characteristics of formal and informal micro and small nonagricultural firms and identifies the extent of similarities and potential for formalization. The analysis finds that, beyond firm size and whether the firm operates in a fixed establishment, the basic and easily observable characteristics of firms are not closely linked to formality. Firm age, productivity, and owner characteristics, such as education, are strongly predictive of formality. The predicted probability of being formal is greater than 50\% for only about 26\% of informal firms, suggesting most firms are not good candidates for formalization. The paper develops profiles (groups and clusters) of similar firms to identify those with a higher potential for formalization.},

  abstract = {Greater female labor market participation benefits not only women's empowerment and the well-being of their families, but also the economy as a whole. Yet the labor force participation of women in developing countries is relatively stagnant, even with higher levels of economic development and better educational attainment. Women are also more likely to work in the informal sector and unskilled jobs. The arrival of the internet and the subsequent creation of internet-based jobs may positively affect women's labor market outcomes. In this paper, we examine the effect of internet availability on five dimensions of women's labor market outcomes in Indonesia, focusing on the heterogeneity in the impact of internet availability on female labor market outcomes. We construct a balanced pseudo panel covering all districts in the country for 2008 – 2018. We find that internet availability has a small positive effect on the labor force participation and full-time employment of younger or low-educated women. We find a small negative effect on the likelihood of holding skilled jobs for these groups of women. We also find a small negative effect on job formality. These effects are concentrated among low-educated women. The findings are mainly explained by the kind of internet-based jobs that were created in the country. On balance, we do not find evidence that the internet significantly improves women's labor market outcomes.},

Firm-level evidence suggests that during the credit crunch of 2008-09, healthy firms with less than 50 employees borrowing from troubled banks grew faster in sectors where production factors were sufficiently substitutable. This effect is made possible by firms’ substituting labor for capital when the rental cost of capital increases. Our analysis sheds new light on the importance of labor regulation and the technological substitutability of the factors of production in enabling firms to adjust to financial shocks.},

The structure and patterns and relationships of a system emerge from interactions among components, thus each system is unique. Systems have common defining properties, such as hierarchical ordering, coupling, permeability, holism, emergence, equifinality, and homeostasis. Representing the broader systems perspective are several specific theories and perspectives, such as Weick's theory of organizing, communication network perspectives, ecological and evolutionary perspectives, and self-organizing systems theory. Systems theory has been extensively applied in research areas ranging from communication design and adoption of technology use in organizational operations to professional communication, health campaigns, and public relations.},

Yet their role in economic development remains controversial with some viewing informality as pent-up potential and others viewing informality as a parasitic organizational form that hinders economic growth. In this paper, we assess these perspectives. We argue that the evidence is most consistent with dual models, in which informality arises out of poverty and the informal and formal sectors are very different. It seems that informal firms have low productivity and produce low- quality products; and, consequently, they do not pose a threat to the formal firms. Economic growth comes from the formal sector, that is, from firms run by educated entrepreneurs and exhibiting much higher levels of productivity. The expansion of the formal sector leads to the decline of the informal sector in relative and eventually absolute terms. A few informal firms convert to formality, but more generally they disappear because they cannot compete with the much more-productive formal firms.},

We investigate whether there exist common firm-level characteristics that play a significant role in determining firm-level performance across the three countries, and whether development in financial markets can facilitate the growth of individual firms, particularly for firms that require external financing (borrowing). Our empirical analysis shows that in the case of Poland, firm-level characteristics, such as firm age and firm size, turn out to be significant, and that the role of these factors on the sales growth of firms is quite consistent with the findings in the existing literature. The same firm-level characteristics do not appear to be significant in the cases of Czechia and Hungary, which suggests that these factors play a different role in the firm-level growth of these countries. However, a firm’s access to external financing matters for the determining the firm’s growth and its development of financial markets, which enables the firm to have easier access to external sources of financing, thereby especially facilitating the growth of the individual firm that might need external funds. Our findings provide additional empirical evidence on the existing literature that emphasizes the positive impact of financial development on the individual firms’ growth based on a cross-country analysis.},

We operationalize the elements and outputs of entrepreneurial ecosystems for 273 European regions. The ecosystem elements show strong and positive correlations with each other, confirming the systemic nature of entrepreneurial economies and the need for a complex systems perspective. Our analyses show that physical infrastructure, finance, formal institutions, and talent take a central position in the interdependence web, providing a first indication of these elements as fundamental conditions of entrepreneurial ecosystems. The measures of the elements are used to calculate an index that approximates the quality of entrepreneurial ecosystems. This index is robust and performs well in regressions to predict entrepreneurial output, which we measure with novel data on productive entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach and the metrics we present provide a lens for public policy to better diagnose, understand and improve entrepreneurial economies.},

It is found that the link between exporting and productivity is a weak one in Malaysia. Productivity is driven mainly by capital intensity and human capital but this may not necessarily translate into export dynamism. Innovation, whether it is product or process innovation, is likely to be the key driver in exporting. Exporters are likely to be larger firms with foreign ownership. There is some evidence that trade liberalization may promote exports especially for non-innovating firms. The main policy implication of the findings from this study is that policy makers should focus on enhancing innovation capabilities to ensure export dynamism. There is a need to also consider policies to enhance productivity improvements in sectors with export potential. Policy makers should additionally examine the possibility of lowering tariff levels in industries with relatively lower incidence of innovating but with high export potential. More attention should also be paid to providing a conducive environment for small domestic firms to innovate and venture into exporting.},

We put a particular emphasis on the analytical procedures and offer solutions to dealing with potential pitfalls when using QCA-based methods and highlight opportunities for future entrepreneurship research.},

  abstract = {Taking Southeast Asian emerging economies as an empirical case, this study explores how the reverse salients that have emerged during the transitional process may be overcome efficiently and effectively. In particular, three action-oriented case studies derived from a heuristic research approach are presented to show how Taiwan is empowering its universities and public research institutes to act as innovation niche seeders for Southeast Asian economies, thereby compensating for the weakness of their socio-technical systems (i.e. the reverse salients). Presently, the government-led policies of Southeast Asian countries are largely oriented towards incentivizing foreign multinational corporations to lead the development of domestic production networks. This strategy allows these countries to acquire the necessary resources for an economic transition in the era of digitalization, although at the expense of developing their own innovation niches. This study presents the urgency of a need for a new approach, and a new avenue for emerging countries to develop an effective and efficient governance model. The proposed model would allow external institutional mechanisms, such as universities and public research institutes, to act as critical intermediaries providing an alternative solution for the dilemmas faced by small and medium-sized enterprise-centric emerging countries. Policy implications for building sustainable socio-technical regimes in Southeast Asia’s transitional emerging countries are also discussed.},

Twenty-five teachers received training in December 2017 and subsequently conducted 30 trainings for 601 students in West Java from January through May 2018. The training consisted of 18 sessions covering basics of financial literacy and employment–related soft skills. Both participating trainers and students showed statistically significant increases in financial literacy knowledge, and student perceptions about their acquisition of soft skills improved as well. Increases in student financial literacy knowledge were found to relate to prior knowledge, job experience, the type of school they attend, the perceived acquisition of soft skills, and the intention to incorporate the training into their daily lives. Given that the economic education literature links financial literacy to improved worker productivity, decreased absenteeism, and entrepreneurial success, these findings are encouraging for both the students involved and for their employers in Indonesia.},

Enterprises managed by women have lower expected growth rates. Proprietary firms face lower growth on the whole, especially if they are young firms. Exporting has a positive effect on firm growth, especially for young firms and for female-owned firms. Although some small firms are able to convert know-how into commercial success, we find that many others are unable to translate it into superior growth.},

Current work on EE, however, focuses on documenting the presence of system components, which means there is little understanding of interdependencies between EE components and their evolutionary dynamics. To address these issues, the objective of the present study is to develop an evolutionary framework of EE development that integrates important components from prior work and describes how critical elements of an entrepreneurial system interact and evolve over time. The value of this framework in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of EE will be demonstrated by profiling the EE of Phoenix, Arizona. The evolutionary perspective developed is valuable because it provides a sense of how history, culture and the institutional setting impact EE. It also provides stakeholders with action points to help maintain or propel an EE to the next level. This is a distinct improvement over static approaches that provide a list of EE ingredients with no sense of their relative importance over time. The proposed framework may also be used in a comparative context to compare and contrast the evolutionary trajectory of EE to better understand why particular places remain trapped in a specific phase of growth or continue to evolve over time.},

In growth industries, the effect of financial dependence on acquisitions and plant openings is mitigated for conglomerate firms. Plants acquired by conglomerate firms increase in productivity.

However, the diversity of business entities and their business environment raises the importance of considering the unique nature of the industry in the selection of performance measures. Our research focuses on real estate valuation firms that provide information and consulting services to real estate markets. Purpose of the article: As professional practice shows, there are different business models for property valuation. These businesses differ in their organisational and legal form and the type of valuations performed, the type of client served, or the scope of services provided. The main purpose of the research is to identify factors that significantly affect the development odds of valuation companies in Poland, especially the growth of income. Methods: The study was based on data collected from the survey of Polish real estate valuers. The analysis was conducted on a sample of 277 professionals who own valuation companies and were certified no later than the end of 2014. A quantitative analysis using a logistic regression model was conducted to identify the factors that influence the prospects for valuation business growth. Findings \&amp; value added: The research confirms the relationship between the way of conducting real estate valuation activities and its development chances. The most important factors are a~spatial and substantive range of services, cooperation and employment, and clients' profile. Demographic characteristics were also found to be significant. Although the results presented here are based on data from the real estate valuation industry, their relevance is much broader. The findings provide a better understanding of the factors that influence the performance and success of SMEs, particularly in the information and consulting industry.},

A previous study used the Annual National Industrial Survey (ENIA) panel (1995–2014) to estimate the value of water and own-price elasticity through a translog production function. However, that database does not report the industrial firms' location to protect the informants’ statistical secrecy. In contrast, in this study, the survey ENIA 2018 is chosen since it includes the region where each firm is located, which allows for evaluating the endogeneity of the water price variable and using three instrumental variables related to the water supply. In addition, the performance of non-linear regression methods with constraints is evaluated to ensure that the estimated coefficients meet the conditions imposed by economic theory. The results show that the elasticity of industrial water demand is unitary but not statistically significant in most subsectors. The water demand in the wood and paper industry subsector is elastic (−2.2) and statistically significant. On the other hand, the elasticities of substitution obtained adopt values very low, indicating that water is an essential resource that is difficult to replace by other inputs or productive factors.},

I feel I can also utilize these concepts on my own research team and take them out of the classroom and into research team meetings with colleagues." —Deborah Gioia, University of Maryland, Baltimore"I really liked this book. I found myself taking notes and saying "yes" so many times because Maxwell captures the research process so well and provides many points worth quoting. As a faculty mentor, I particularly see the value of this book for my students who are conducting qualitative dissertations." —Mary S. Enright, Capella University"The text is incredibly engaging and practical...So many of the issues raised in the book are central to qualitative research, yet often not explicitly discussed in 'public' venues." - David Carlone, The University of North Carolina at Greensboro"I particularly like the interactive focus and believe that helps students to more realistically engage qualitative research design. It certainly lives up to its billing as a good guidebook, and I appreciate the fact that the author really concentrates on useful content, exercises, insights, and examples, and leaves extensive theory discussions to others." - Sharon L.

  abstract = {Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSSs) are a popular semiparametric modelling approach that, in contrast with conventional generalized additive models, regress not only the expected mean but also every distribution parameter (e.g. location, scale and shape) to a set of covariates. Current fitting procedures for GAMLSSs are infeasible for high dimensional data set-ups and require variable selection based on (potentially problematic) information criteria. The present work describes a boosting algorithm for high dimensional GAMLSSs that was developed to overcome these limitations. Specifically, the new algorithm was designed to allow the simultaneous estimation of predictor effects and variable selection. The algorithm proposed was applied to Munich rental guide data, which are used by landlords and tenants as a reference for the average rent of a flat depending on its characteristics and spatial features. The net rent predictions that resulted from the high dimensional GAMLSSs were found to be highly competitive and covariate-specific prediction intervals showed a major improvement over classical generalized additive models.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses two closely related questions, "What is a statistical model?" and "What is a parameter?" The notions that a model must "make sense," and that a parameter must "have a well-defined meaning" are deeply ingrained in applied statistical work, reasonably well understood at an instinctive level, but absent from most formal theories of modelling and inference. In this paper, these concepts are defined in algebraic terms, using morphisms, functors and natural transformations. It is argued that inference on the basis of a model is not possible unless the model admits a natural extension that includes the domain for which inference is required. For example, prediction requires that the domain include all future units, subjects or time points. Although it is usually not made explicit, every sensible statistical model admits such an extension. Examples are given to show why such an extension is necessary and why a formal theory is required. In the definition of a subparameter, it is shown that certain parameter functions are natural and others are not. Inference is meaningful only for natural parameters. This distinction has important consequences for the construction of prior distributions and also helps to resolve a controversy concerning the Box-Cox model.}

  abstract = {This dissertation attempts to describe and explain the ways in which small businesses . in Indonesia finance their initial establishment and subsequent expansion, and to evaluate the Government's policies relevant to small businesses - particularly those relating to financial aspects. Since the small-business sector is quantitatively very significant, and since little research has been done on the financing of small firms, the study should be useful in helping to formulate future policies and in evaluating current ones. The main data base for the study consists of records of interviews with 114 firms and six commercial banks in Yogyakarta. These interviews were carried out by the author in 1978. Particular attention is given to the popular notion that capital markets are imperfect in less-developed countries, and that this imperfection impinges on small firms in such a way as to constrain their growth. It is argued here that such views are based on superficial and subjective observations of these markets, that there is no substantive evidence to show that they are imperfect, and that small firms' alleged lack of access to finance is greatly exaggerated. The evidence presented in this study suggests that finance is best seen as just one of many problems faced by business owners. Accordingly, it is not access to finance (or lack of it) which is the primary determinant of firms' growth performance, but the entrepreneurial ability of their owners. The Indonesian Government uses the formal finance sector quite extensively as an instrument of economic policy. The most important aspect is the simultaneous subsidisation of State bank lending and control of the interest rates at which this is undertaken. It is argued here that interest rate control works counter to the objectives of the subsidies. This applies to lending policy in general and also to the particular programme which aims to provide greater access to low-cost funds to small pribumi businessmen. Despite the Government's announced intention to promote small pribumi firms, much could be done in several areas by way of changes to other policies which conflict with this objective. Not the least of these would be to discontinue the practice of providing a wide range of explicit and implicit subsidies to large firms.},

Markets developed spontaneously in every transition country, but they were built at varying speeds. Some governments impeded the entrepreneurs' self-help by creating conditions that made it hard for informal contracting to work; others created an environment that was conducive to self-help. The spontaneous emergence of markets, furthermore, has its limits. As firms' activities became more complex, they came to need formal institutions. Some governments fostered entrepreneurship by building market-supporting infrastructure; others did not. The authors argue that the success or failure of a transition economy can be traced in large part to the performance of its entrepreneurs.},

Agriculture pays a wage penalty, and manufacturing offers a statistically significant but small premium.

Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables. The algorithm is shown to be consistent.

  abstract = {Social phenomena can rarely be attributed to single causes--instead, they typically stem from a myriad of interwoven factors that are often difficult to untangle. Drawing on set theory and the language of necessary and sufficient conditions, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is ideally suited to capturing this causal complexity. A case-based research method, QCA regards cases as combinations of conditions and compares the conditions of each case in a structured way to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for an outcome. Qualitative Comparative Analysis: An Introduction to Research Design and Application is a comprehensive guide to QCA. As QCA becomes increasingly popular across the social sciences, this textbook teaches students, scholars, and self-learners the fundamentals of the method, research design, interpretation of results, and how to communicate findings. Following an ideal typical research cycle, the book's ten chapters cover the methodological basis and analytical routine of QCA, as well as matters of research design, causation and causal complexity, QCA variants, and the method's reception in the social sciences. A comprehensive glossary helps to clarify the meaning of frequently used terms. The book is complemented by an accessible online R manual to help new users to practice QCA's analytical steps on sample data and then implement with their own findings. This hands-on textbook is an essential resource for students and researchers looking for a complete and up-to-date introduction to QCA.},

Our findings indicate that private firms with greater financing constraints are less inclined to undergo external audits voluntarily. This effect varies depending on factors such as firm size, business sector, ownership structure, accounting and auditing conditions, as well as the prevailing institutional environment. Our results remain robust even after subjecting them to various sensitivity and endogeneity tests. They suggest that financially constrained firms in developing countries may have stronger motivations to manipulate earnings, employ aggressive tax avoidance strategies, or be susceptible to managerial short-sightedness. Additionally, it is possible that finance providers rely on alternative mechanisms rather than audited accounts to monitor firm performance.},

Discussions of three recent changes in the nature of innovations support the argument. One such change, the technological diversity thesis, purports that innovations tend to draw on an increasingly wider range of technologies and knowledge bases.        A review of the account of the innovation process offered by the (inaccurate) capabilities theory of the firm reveals that capabilities and their exploitation have been generally viewed as the province of individual firms acting alone. The discrepancy between theory and observation may be resolved by extending the capabilities theory to embrace a multi-firm perspective on innovation. The organizational structures that firms use to coordinate their contributions to innovative collaborations are listed and classified.        Factors that play into the decisions of firms as they choose among cooperative arrangements include the relative size and power of the collaborators and the risk and uncertainty involved. The business landscape is populated by a wide variety of diverse, locally embedded, and evolving capabilities, the creation and ownership of which are in a state of flux. (SAA)},

In this article we demonstrate how the integration of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and conventional statistical analysis offers researchers new opportunities for contributing to the social sciences. Whereas statistical analysis is variable-oriented and relies on correlational analysis to make comparisons across cases, QCA is based on set theory, is case oriented, and relies on Boolean algebra to make comparisons between cases. Drawing on the literature on the interdependency between theoretical contribution and methodology, we review studies that integrate QCA and statistical analysis to explain how the specific combination of these two approaches allows researchers to strengthen the theoretical contribution of their research. From our review we identify common challenges and provide solutions for integrating QCA and statistical analysis.},

  abstract = {Causal complexity has long been recognized as a ubiquitous feature underlying organizational phenomena, yet current theories and methodologies in management are for the most part not well-suited to its direct study. The introduction of the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) configurational approach has led to a reinvigoration of configurational theory that embraces causal complexity explicitly. We argue that the burgeoning research using QCA represents more than a novel methodology; it constitutes the emergence of a neo-configurational perspective to the study of management and organizations that enables a fine-grained conceptualization and empirical investigation of causal complexity through the logic of set theory. In this article, we identify four foundational elements that characterize this emerging neo-configurational perspective: (a) conceptualizing cases as set theoretic configurations, (b) calibrating cases’ memberships into sets, (c) viewing causality in terms of necessity and sufficiency relations between sets, and (d) conducting counterfactual analysis of unobserved configurations. We then present a comprehensive review of the use of QCA in management studies that aims to capture the evolution of the neo-configurational perspective among management scholars. We close with a discussion of a research agenda that can further this neo-configurational approach and thereby shift the attention of management research away from a focus on net effects and towards examining causal complexity.},

To do so, we integrate extant theory and research to specify the bundle of mechanisms that operate to mitigate the agency problem among publicly traded corporations and review what previous research has said about how these mechanisms combine. We then use the fuzzy-set approach to qualitative comparitive analysis (QCA) to explore the combinations of governance mechanisms that exist among the S\&P 1500 firms that achieve high (and not-high) profitability. Our findings suggest that high profits result when CEO incentive alignment and monitoring mechanisms work together as complements rather than as substitutes. Furthermore, they show that high profits are obtained when both internal and external monitoring mechanisms are present. At the same time, however, monitoring mechanisms evidently combine in complex ways such that there may be simultaneity of substitution and complementarity among and across the various monitoring and control mechanisms. Our findings clearly suggest that the effectiveness of board independence and CEO non-duality—governance mechanisms widely believed to singularly resolve the agency problem—depends on how each combine with the other mechanisms in the governance bundle.

Less well-off consumers generate demand for the low-priced, low quality good produced by the informal sector. Our paper studies the implications of this link for the size of the informal sector. Second, we analyse a situation where, instead of competing with the formal sector firm, the informal sector firm produces an intermediate good for the other firm.},

Estimation of dynamic models with such data is made difficult by the general lack of information on lagged dependent and independent variables and the consequent unobservability of the intertemporal covariances needed to identify and estimate dynamic models. It is demonstrated here that the parameters of such models, both linear and nonlinear, both with and without fixed individual effects, are identified and can be consistently estimated with the imposition of certain restrictions. The paper includes an examination of the identification and estimation with repeated cross-sectional data of dynamic discrete dependent variable models, which can be parameterized in terms of transition rates between the different cross-sections.},

However, we know little about how family businesses grow. Our research analyses differences in growth patterns between family and non-family businesses, considering two dimensions of business growth: sales (performance) and employees (resources). Based on the Penrosean resource-based view of the firm and socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective, we test and find —using a panel of 2000 Spanish manufacturing companies (2006–2014) —that family businesses tend to grow less than non-family businesses in terms of sales but more in terms of employees. Our research casts doubt on the myth of low growth in family businesses and shows that SEW should complement the Penrosean approach to explain the growth of family businesses.},

Moreover, the analysis shed some light on the relationship between growth and performance and on the growth process of a subsample of young, fast-growing firms to check the presence of differences in the process or the strategy of growth. We find a positive and significant relation between present growth and proxy variables for resources organization, a lumpy growth process, and a positive association of growth and profit for almost the whole sample, i.e., a positive balance between costs and benefit of growth.},

Beginning with a critique of General System Theory and the principle of holism with which it is associated, the author suggests that contemporary advances in our knowledge of organization call for a radical reformation in our organization of knowledge. This reformation involves the mobilization of recursive thinking, which is to say a manner of thinking capable of establishing a dynamic and generative feedback loop between terms or concepts (such as whole and part, order and disorder, observer and observed, system and ecosystem, etc.) that remain both complementary and antagonistic. The paradigm of complexity thus stands as a bold challenge to the fragmentary and reductionistic spirit that continues to dominate the scientific enterprise.},

Our findings suggest that financing constraints hamper SMEs’ growth and that the effect is stronger for perceived, rather than actual, financing constraints. On the other hand, increased banking markets integration in the euro area appears to foster SMEs’ growth. Furthermore, we found that the reduction in financing constraints is crucial in the transmission channel from banking markets integration to growth. This effect appears significantly stronger when integration is measured by the intensity of cross-border lending than through convergence in interest rates to loans to nonfinancial corporations.},

Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble—and thus where they can be most usefully applied.},

The analysis reveals that social institutions matter in toning down risks associated with global interest rate. Political stability is vital in moderating the negative effects linked to EPU, while social cohesion mitigates the stressful (negative) effects of soaring debt–GDP ratios. Institutions and domestic conditions serve as devices to partially insulate economies from stress conditions, including the spillovers from the unconventional monetary policy originating from the frontier countries. Policy responses should emphasize on reforming institutions to smooth the fluctuations of portfolio capital inflows and to procure stronger growth. The empirical results show that democracy matters in the growth empiric. The economic-enhancing benefits of portfolio investments remain fairly robust to several measures of institutions.},

Building on Penrose's theory of the growth of the firm and on the research streams she has in part inspired, we investigate the impact of knowledge acquisition from international markets on entrepreneurial growth both at home and abroad. We further suggest that the effects of international knowledge acquisition on entrepreneurial growth will vary with firm age. Utilizing longitudinal data on 138 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that the acquisition of knowledge from international markets fuels growth through market development, and that this effect is stronger for international expansion than domestic expansion. Our results also show that firm age negatively moderates the relationship between international knowledge acquisition and entrepreneurial growth via the introduction of new products or services. Specifically, international knowledge acquisition has a positive effect on growth via new products/services development in young firms, but a negative effect in mature firms. We assume this reflects changes over time in how international knowledge is managed.},

Winter focus their critique on the basic question of how firms and industries change overtime. They marshal significant objections to the fundamental neoclassical assumptions of profit maximization and market equilibrium, which they find ineffective in the analysis of technological innovation and the dynamics of competition among firms.To replace these assumptions, they borrow from biology the concept of natural selection to construct a precise and detailed evolutionary theory of business behavior. They grant that films are motivated by profit and engage in search for ways of improving profits, but they do not consider them to be profit maximizing. Likewise, they emphasize the tendency for the more profitable firms to drive the less profitable ones out of business, but they do not focus their analysis on hypothetical states of industry equilibrium.The results of their new paradigm and analytical framework are impressive. Not only have they been able to develop more coherent and powerful models of competitive firm dynamics under conditions of growth and technological change, but their approach is compatible with findings in psychology and other social sciences. Finally, their work has important implications for welfare economics and for government policy toward industry.},

These asymmetric least squares estimators have properties which are analogous to regression quantile estimators, but are much simpler to calculate, as are the corresponding test statistics. The coefficient estimators can be used to construct test statistics for homoskedasticity and conditional symmetry of the error distribution, and we find these tests compare quite favorably with other commonly-used tests of these null hypotheses in terms of local relative efficiency. Consequently, asymmetric least squares estimation provides a convenient and relatively efficient method of summarizing the conditional distribution of a dependent variable given the regressors, and a means of testing whether a linear model is an adequate characterization of the "typical value" for this conditional distribution.}

However, providing financing to offset scale has the potential to increase sales but reduce business growth. Thus, businesses in the SKEZ need to carry out some following points.

Existing research studies provide long lists of relevant eco-factors; however, the causal relations of eco-factors with productive entrepreneurship has not been sufficiently and holistically studied. As the research on entrepreneurial ecosystems continues to develop, there is a need for a measurement framework and subsequent empirical validation of these causal relations. Otherwise, research on entrepreneurial ecosystem risks engaging only in a simple description of successful territories without the possibility of generalizing findings. Therefore, our paper’s contribution is a critical review of the set of eco-factors proposed by the extant literature and propose indicators and related data sources that could be used to measure the indicators more holistically. In an analogous way, with respect to eco-output, our contribution is to trace which indicators are the appropriate proxies for productive entrepreneurship and to explore the data sources for these indicators.},

  abstract = {In recent years, problems such as environmental and economic crises and pandemics caused by new viruses have been occurring on a global scale. Globalization brings about benefits, but it can increase the potential risks of “systemic problems”, leading to system-wide disruptions. The coronavirus pandemic, declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization, has revealed social disparities in the form of a higher risk of death for people of low-socioeconomic status and has caused massive destruction of the economy and of globalization itself. Extensive efforts to cope with these challenges have often led to the emergence of additional problems due to the chain of hidden causation. What can be done to protect against such emerging challenges?  Despite the resulting complexity, once these individual problems are considered as different aspects of a single whole, seemingly contradictory issues can become totally understandable, as they can be integrated into a single coherent framework. This is the integrationist approach in contrast to the reductionist approach. Situations of this kind are truly relevant to understanding the question, “What are creative complex systems?” This book features contributions by members and colleagues of the Kyoto University International Research Unit of Integrated Complex System Science. It broadens our outlook from the traditional view of stability, in which global situations are eventually stabilized after the impact of destruction, to “creative” complex systems.},

  abstract = {The robustness of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) results features high on the agenda of methodologists and practitioners. This article aims at advancing this debate on several fronts. First, in line with the extant literature, we take a comprehensive view on robustness arguing that decisions on calibration, consistency, and frequency thresholds should all be tested. Second, we introduce the notion of “sensitivity range” as the range of values for any of these parameters within which the solution formula remains unchanged. Third, we argue that interpreting robustness is more intricate than simply checking if solutions remain unchanged. Beyond sensitivity ranges, researchers should assess robustness by evaluating changes in parameters of fit and the classification of cases as robust, shaky, or possible. Fourth, we enable researchers to perform more than one robustness test at a time by proposing the notions of a “test set”: the overlap between conceptually plausible alternative solutions that can be generated; and of a “robust core”: that part of a QCA solution that withstands the robustness checks. Fifth, we present functionalities implemented in the R package SetMethods that enable researchers to put in practice our proposals. These advancements are integrated into a comprehensive QCA Robustness Test Protocol consisting of three main tests: sensitivity ranges, fit-oriented robustness, and case-oriented robustness. We illustrate the protocol’s implementation with an example on high life expectancy across the globe.},

This study employs unique data from Indonesia to investigate whether and how digitalization of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) helped them weather the adverse shocks from the pandemic and resulting lockdowns. The main empirical result is that, in the pandemic’s early phases, digitalized MSMEs disproportionately encountered negative effects on their business outcomes. The seemingly harmful elements of digitalization disappeared during later stages. Moreover, COVID-19 restrictions initially had a “positive” impact on the business environment. This is counterintuitive. But when considering the panic buying at the onset of restrictions and large share held by the essential sector in our dataset, particularly the wholesale and retail sectors, the positive impact from the restrictions is not unreasonable. These findings suggest that the digital transformation had not yet been stably established among MSMEs by the start of the pandemic. Our findings provide critical implications for industrial and competition policies related to MSMEs during the COVID-19 recovery process.},

  abstract = {The capability of firms to survive and to have a competitive advantage in global markets depends on, amongst other things, the efficiency of public institutions, the excellence of educational, health and communications infrastructures, as well as on the political and economic stability of their home country. The measurement of competitiveness and strategy development is thus an important issue for policy-makers. Despite many attempts to provide objectivity in the development of measures of national competitiveness, there are inherently subjective judgments that involve, for example, how data sets are aggregated and importance weights are applied. Generally, either equal weighting is assumed in calculating a final index, or subjective weights are specified. The same problem also occurs in the subjective assignment of countries to different clusters. Developed as such, the value of these type indices may be questioned by users. The aim of this paper is to explore methodological transparency as a viable solution to problems created by existing aggregated indices. For this purpose, a methodology composed of three steps is proposed. To start, a hierarchical clustering analysis is used to assign countries to appropriate clusters. In current methods, country clustering is generally based on GDP. However, we suggest that GDP alone is insufficient for purposes of country clustering. In the proposed methodology, 178 criteria are used for this purpose. Next, relationships between the criteria and classification of the countries are determined using artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANN provides an objective method for determining the attribute/criteria weights, which are, for the most part, subjectively specified in existing methods. Finally, in our third step, the countries of interest are ranked based on weights generated in the previous step. Beyond the ranking of countries, the proposed methodology can also be used to identify those attributes that a given country should focus on in order to improve its position relative to other countries, i.e., to transition from its current cluster to the next higher one.},

We show how QCA as a research approach is composed of (1) an “analytical move”, where cases, conditions and outcome(s) are conceptualised in terms of sets, and (2) a “membership move”, where set membership values are qualitatively assigned by the researcher (i.e. calibration). Moreover, we show that QCA scholars have not sufficiently acknowledged the data generation process as a constituent research phase (or “move”) for the performance of QCA. This is particularly relevant when qualitative data–e.g. interviews, focus groups, documents–are used for subsequent analysis and calibration (i.e. analytical and membership moves). We call the qualitative data collection process “relational move” because, for data gathering, researchers establish the social relation “interview” with the study participants. By using examples from our own research, we show how a dialogical interviewing style can help researchers gain the in-depth knowledge necessary to meaningfully represent qualitative data into set membership values for QCA, hence improving our ability to account for the “qualitative” in QCA.},

The results, however, have remained largely inconclusive, perhaps because the role of board gender diversity has been studied separately from other board and firm characteristics. To address this issue, we examine the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance through the theoretical framework of complexity theory, using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Our sample comprises 204 non-financial firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). We find that board gender diversity does not affect firm financial performance in isolation, but rather in combination with other board and firm characteristics. In some combinations it is associated with both stronger firm financial performance and in other configurations with weaker firm financial performance. We also find that greater gender diversity on boards mitigates the negative effects of CEO duality on firm financial performance.},

This article helps the reader to gain richer information from their data and understand the importance of avoiding shallow information‐from‐data reporting. To this end, it proposes a different research paradigm that includes asymmetric, configurational‐focused case‐outcome theory construction and somewhat precise outcome testing. This article offers a detailed step-by-step guide on how to employ fsQCA by using as an example an already published study. We analyze the same dataset and present all the details in each step of the analysis to guide the reader onto how to employ fsQCA. The article discusses differences between fsQCA and variance-based approaches and compares fsQCA with those from structured equation modelling. Finally, the article offers a summary of thresholds and guidelines for practice, along with a discussion on how existing papers that employ variance-based methods are extendable and complemented through fsQCA.},

  abstract = {The growth dynamics of firms have been object of numerous studies by econophysicists. The vast majority of these studies was done for large developed countries including the United States of America (US), France and Italy. These studies were conducted for countries with strong economies and whose business fabric has different characteristics from countries such as Portugal or Spain, with more large-sized firms and less micro-sized firms. It is thus important to study the growth dynamics of firms in Portugal and Spain, countries with economies that typically display anemic growth indexes and have a larger percentage of micro-sized firms. Considering two large samples of Portuguese and Spanish firms, we find that the size distribution of firms is well fitted by the generalized Pareto distribution. Moreover, the distribution of Iberian firms annual growth rates is best approximated by the Cauchy distribution rather than the Laplace distribution. Firms growth standard deviation conditional on size is well approximated by power-law relationships with a scaling exponent close to 12 for micro/small-sized firms and close to 0 for medium/large-sized firms.},

  abstract = {Some geographical locations have characteristics that create opportunities for de novo enterprises, but not all new firms can access the benefits presented by a potential location. The ability of new firms to appropriate benefit and avoid risk depends on the resources that entrepreneurs can marshal for their enterprise. This article develops a model of the interplay between the attributes of de novo entrants and their founding locations. The model assumes that de novo entrants tend to appear in the region where their founders live, but that founders choose among locations within their regions.The test of the model, using data on all de novo entrants in the Canadian manufacturing sector during 1984—98, reveals that entrants with greater resource and capability endowments are more likely to locate in areas with an agglomeration of similar firms, but this effect reverses at high endowment levels. Additionally, larger entrants are less likely to locate in areas characterized by intense local competition and potential entry deterrence, while smaller and well-endowed entrants tend to locate in areas where entry barriers are lower and asset turnover higher. These findings suggest that entrants choose locations strategically within their founding regions.They also indicate that the strategic imperatives of de novo entrants differ significantly from those of geographically diversifying firms, and thus suggest amendments to theories of location choice when modeling the decisions of new ventures.},

Using a comprehensive panel of Spanish firms for the period 2004–2011, the empirical analysis conducted shows that distinct types of obstacle are perceived differently by firms of different ages. First, a clear-cut negative relationship is identified between firm age and a firm’s assessment of both the internal and external shortages of financial resources. Second, young firms seem to be less sensitive to the lack of qualified personnel when initiating an innovative project than when they are already engaged in such activities. By contrast, the attempts of mature firms to engage in innovation activity are significantly affected by the lack of qualified personnel. Finally, mature incumbents appear to attach greater importance to obstacles related to market structure and demand than is the case of firms with less experience.},

What leads to the practice of appointing outside directors in the absence of legal mandate? This article addresses these two important questions by drawing not only on agency theory, but also resource dependence and institutional theories. Taking advantage of China's institutional transitions, our findings, based on an archival database covering 405 publicly listed firms and 1211 company–years, suggest that outsider directors do make a difference in firm performance, if such performance is measured by sales growth, and that they have little impact on financial performance such as return on equity (ROE). The results also document a bandwagon effect behind the diffusion of the practice of appointing outsiders to corporate boards. The article not only highlights the need to incorporate multiple theories beyond agency theory in corporate governance research, but also generates policy implications in light of the recent trend toward having more outside directors on corporate boards in emerging economies.

However, even in a recessionary period, there will always be some firms growing faster than others. It is therefore imperative to understand the variables and processes that make some firms grow faster or more resilient to crisis than others. In this paper, we focus on firm size and its contributions to growth. We examine whether growth rates of manufacturing and service industries are independent of firm size during the period of economic crisis. Based on a large sample of surviving firms in the manufacturing and hospitality industries, the results of two-step dynamic panel suggest that turnover growth is positively associated with companies’ size during the observed period of economic recession 2008–2013. In both industries, large and medium-sized firms exhibit higher growth than do small firms.},

  abstract = {Resource-based theory (RBT) is a prime example of a theory that integrates a management perspective with an economics perspective. As such, its challenge is to keep its arguments logically consistent and clear, despite the risk of their becoming entangled, due to competing and possibly conflicting theoretical influences. We argue, in this paper, that to meet this challenge, it is essential to understand the limits to the domain of RBT. Unless RBT is understood as a resource-level and efficiency-oriented analytical tool, its contribution cannot be understood and appreciated fully. Incorporating aspects of economic theory that fall outside this domain will not increase its power and will only add to the confusion. Continued efforts to increase the analytic precision of RBT and to elaborate its economic logic, however, are worthwhile pursuits. To these aims, then, we provide a sharper definition of competitive advantage, linking this term to value creation and to demand side concerns. Similarly, we provide an economically meaningful definition of value and more precise definitions of critical resources and of economic rents. This allows us to trace a clearer trail of logic, consistent with both the management and the economics perspectives, leading from critical resources to the generation of rents.

Market turbulence generated by core firm decisions in competing differentiated ecosystems can generate financial losses and exit for complementary niche market firms. I develop hypotheses predicting which niche markets will suffer larger losses and be more susceptible to shakeouts, and how core firm decisions will drive complementor performance and survival. I then apply these hypotheses to brand-based differentiated ecosystems in the automotive industry, where networks of suppliers, customers, and complementors surround car manufacturers. More specifically, I study the complementary niche market of automotive leasing, where manufacturers sway leasing markets through product change, entry, and subsidization. To test the hypotheses, I use a proprietary dataset of 200,000 individual car leases between 1997–2002 to identify how manufacturer product design and niche market entry drive complementor losses and exit. These data allow a unique opportunity to understand how the strategic choices of core firms can have substantial and often devastating effects on niche markets in their ecosystem. Further, the results suggest how the dynamic capabilities to adapt to core firm behavior might improve performance for certain niche market complementors. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

For each of these variables we find that the distributions of 𝑅 can be approximated by double exponential (Laplace) distributions in the central parts and power-law distributions in the tails. For each of these variables we further find a power-law dependence of the standard deviation 𝜎⁡(𝑅) on the average size of the economic variable with a scaling exponent surprisingly close to that found for the gross domestic product (GDP) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 3275 (1998)]. By analyzing annual logarithmic growth rates 𝑅 of wages of 161 different occupations, we find a power-law dependence of the standard deviation 𝜎⁡(𝑅) on the average value of the wages with a scaling exponent 𝛽≈0.14 close to those found for the growth of exports, imports, debt, and the growth of the GDP. In contrast to these findings, we observe for payroll data collected from 50 states of the USA that the standard deviation 𝜎⁡(𝑅) of the annual logarithmic growth rate 𝑅 increases monotonically with the average value of payroll. However, also in this case we observe a power-law dependence of 𝜎⁡(𝑅) on the average payroll with a scaling exponent 𝛽≈−0.08. Based on these observations we propose a stochastic process for multiple cross-correlated variables where for each variable (i) the distribution of logarithmic growth rates decays exponentially in the central part, (ii) the distribution of the logarithmic growth rate decays algebraically in the far tails, and (iii) the standard deviation of the logarithmic growth rate depends algebraically on the average size of the stochastic variable.},

  abstract = {We exploit the exogenous variation in regional credit market competition brought on by banking deregulation to study the evolution of the gender gap in labor force participation in local US markets. We find that intrastate deregulation increased substantially female labor force participation rates, owing to three separate mechanisms: an increase in the rates of net job creation by private firms, an expansion of services-producing sectors, and an increase in the share of jobs requiring female-specific skills. This effect is robust to controlling for a range of socio-economic developments, as well as for a US-wide gender-specific trend. Overall, intrastate deregulation reduced the gender gap in labor force participation by at least 7.5\%.},

Finally, we show that firms’ sales and employment have suffered more due to corruption and liquidity crunches during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The estimated impact decreases monotonically thereafter as financial constraints become less binding allowing the firms to finance successively bigger portion of their growth through external financing.},

Paradoxically, the fuzzy set is a powerful tool because it replaces an unwieldy, "fuzzy" instrument—the variable, which establishes only the positions of cases relative to each other, with a precise one—degree of membership in a well-defined set.  Ragin argues that fuzzy sets allow a far richer dialogue between ideas and evidence in social research than previously possible. They let quantitative researchers abandon "homogenizing assumptions" about cases and causes, they extend diversity-oriented research strategies, and they provide a powerful connection between theory and data analysis. Most important, fuzzy sets can be carefully tailored to fit evolving theoretical concepts, sharpening quantitative tools with in-depth knowledge gained through qualitative, case-oriented inquiry. This book will revolutionize research methods not only in sociology, political science, and anthropology but in any field of inquiry dealing with complex patterns of causation.},

In contrast to prior work, Ragin and Fiss bring an intersectional approach to the evidence, analyzing the different ways that advantages and disadvantages combine in their impact on life chances. Moving beyond controversy and fixed policy positions, the authors propose sophisticated new methods of analysis to underscore the importance of attending to configurations of race, gender, family background, educational achievement, and related conditions when addressing social inequality in America today.},

Instead, Ragin proposes the use of set-theoretic methods to find a middle path between quantitative and qualitative research. Through a series of contrasts between fuzzy-set analysis and conventional quantitative research, Ragin demonstrates the capacity for set-theoretic methods to strengthen connections between qualitative researchers’ deep knowledge of their cases and quantitative researchers’ elaboration of cross-case patterns.

  abstract = {Purpose The paper examines the differential effect of liquidity constraints on corporate growth using unbalanced panel data for 457 Pakistani firms over the period 2010–2017. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the probability of a financial unconstrained index constructed by estimating the endogenous regression model. This approach provides a time-varying measure of financial position for all firm-year observations and takes into account the different degrees of liquidity constraints that a company faces in attaining funds from external markets. It is derived from a multivariate selection equation that simultaneously accounts for all-important features of the underlying company identified in the literature. The cash flow variable has then interacted with various groups of dummy variables for financial constraint, which allows the coefficient of cash flow to vary across firm-year observations in the different liquidity constraint categories. The two-step system-GMM estimator is applied to estimate the main empirical model. Findings The results of the study provide evidence of the heterogeneity in firms' growth sensitivity to internal funds, depending on the degree of liquidity constraints. Financing growth through internal funds is found to be essential for both liquidity unconstrained and constrained corporates. However, it is observed that the coefficient of cash flow is greater for firms that do not have access to external financing and it eventually decreases with reductions in the magnitude of liquidity constraints, making the least constrained corporates' growth less responsive to internal funds. The results further indicate that smaller and younger firms show higher responsiveness of growth to internal funds. This finding is mainly attributed to financial market imperfections that make external funding difficult for them. Practical implications The results suggest that financially constrained firms should expand their corporate size more than the magnitude of positive income shocks they encounter. The study also suggests important policy implications for liquidity-constrained firms to carefully concentrate on their financing strategies to enhance their growth. By improving the corporate's capacity for production, corporates can achieve a faster effect of a potential positive income shock on their growth. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature by constructing a financial constraint index by running the endogenous regression model. It also contributes by investigating the differential impact of credit constraints on firms' growth in Pakistan and how corporate size and age affect firm growth when financial constraints and investment opportunities are controlled.},

In thirteen chapters, it provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the concepts and methods of complexity economics and their applications to economic issues. The book explains that the complexity approach is not just another method, but a worldview that is different from the one of academics with neoclassical training. By contrasting complexity economics with neoclassical economics, the readers are induced to reflect on their own unconscious beliefs about the economic world and develop their own approach to dealing with the pervasive complexities and uncertainties of reality. The first five chapters serve as an introduction and overview. Chapters 6 - 12 present the core concepts of the book. Each of the seven chapters introduces a key concept of complexity and provides applications to economics topics. The final chapter discusses the implications of complexity thinking for economic policy and for the future development of economics. This textbook addresses advanced undergraduate students and graduate students of economics, interested in a better understanding of the concepts and the way of thinking in complexity economics, as well as in acquiring a sound technical foundation to understand most of the research literature},

The book advances the understanding of technological change by explictly recognising its essential diversity and path-dependent nature. Individual chapters explore the particular features of new technologies in different historical and sectoral contexts. This book presents a unique account of how technological change is generated and the processes by which improved technologies are introduced.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews competing theories about the causes of informality in developing countries and uses new data to determine which theory best explains the persistence and scale of Indonesia’s informal sector. Using nationally representative survey data on micro, small, and medium-sized firms, we find that most of Indonesia’s informal firms are very small, micro firms, with less than five employees. These firms pay low wages, are relatively unproductive when compared to large firms, are managed by individuals with low educational attainment, predominantly supply products to local markets, and have not recently attempted to expand their operations. From a small-scale, qualitative survey of firms, we find that many informal firms do not register their businesses either because they have no desire to expand or borrow from formal financial sources, or because they are avoiding taxes. Finally, we evaluate the impact of Indonesia’s one-stop-shops for business registration program, a large-scale program that attempted to reduce registration costs. We find both that the program had no effects on firms’ informality rates, and we also find that it did not reduce the probability that workers were informally employed. Taken together, the evidence suggests that a combination of the rational exit and the dual economy theories best explains why so many firms in Indonesia are informal.},

  abstract = {Entrepreneurial ecosystems are receiving heightened attention from scholars and practitioners. Studies have focused on isolating entrepreneurial ecosystems' components; however, prior research has not offered a theory of entrepreneurial ecosystems that embraces their complexity. To address this omission in ecosystems research, we contend that entrepreneurial ecosystems can be more fully understood if examined through the lens of complexity science and conceptualized as complex adaptive systems. We contribute to entrepreneurship research by developing a complexity-based definition of entrepreneurial ecosystems. Building on this definition, we connect the research on entrepreneur- and venture-level complexity to work on entrepreneurial ecosystems and propose three related forces that will influence entrepreneurial ecosystem emergence: intentionality of entrepreneurs, coherence of entrepreneurial activities, and injections of resources. Beyond developing theory, we describe how scholars can examine entrepreneurial ecosystems as complex systems using qualitative comparative analysis, agent-based modeling, and interpretivist methods. Our theorizing also has implications for entrepreneurs and policymakers.},

Imported intermediate inputs are found to be associated with higher overall sales, foreign exports and larger sales to multinational companies domiciled in the home country. On the other hand, domestic inputs are not found to have statistically significant positive effect on any firm-level outcomes. Since exporting firms are usually more productive than domestic firms, the results point towards the salience of outsourcing inputs in supporting firm productivity and the importance of policymaking in facilitating trade in intermediate inputs across countries.

Using dynamic panel data estimation techniques, the authors find strong support for a direct relationship between innovative activity and public service quality and for a moderating role of both customer and learning orientation.

The results strongly support the view that non-R\&D activities such as design, the use of advanced machinery and training are crucial to understanding the innovation process of any firm. The study finds, however, that the impact of these activities is especially important in LMT industries, particularly for the achievement of product innovations. The empirical evidence also reveals the importance of external sources such as the use of consultants, the hiring of personnel, collaboration agreements and external R\&D, with the greatest differences between LMT and high-technology (HT) firms being observed in process innovations.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the research is to identify the major constraints to the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in a less-developed region of an emerging economy and how these constraints are affected by owner/manager's attributes and firm-specific characteristics. Design/methodology/approach To fulfill the objectives, a structured questionnaire is used to gather data from 200 randomly selected MSMEs located in Cachar district of Assam, India. The study applies factor analysis to categorize various perceived constraints into resolute sets of problem variables or factors. Then, the summated scales are regressed on the predictors related to owner-manager's attributes and firm characteristics to validate the hypotheses. Findings The results demonstrate that the broad factors constraining the development of MSMEs in Cachar district are as follows: (1) financial issues, (2) infrastructure problems, (3) labor and management issues, (4) market problems and (5) input problems. Furthermore, the findings confirm that firm growth, size, age, sector, location, innovation activity, owner-manager's gender, age and level of education significantly affect the identified constraints. Research limitations/implications Although the research is limited to the Cachar district of India, the findings are relevant for other similar districts of India and less-developed regions of emerging economies. However, the study needs to be replicated in other regions of India as well as in other emerging economies for cross-validation and to determine the generalizability of the results. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, no studies linking the constraints faced by MSMEs to owner/manager's attributes and firm-specific characteristics are carried out in the north-eastern region of India. The study also extends the limited researches on the influence of owner-manager's attributes and firm characteristics on the constraints to the growth of MSMEs by incorporating additional predictors.},

Although QCA user guides are widely available, researchers may face difficulties in implementing the method to address real-world, complex social phenomena. To address this issue, the present methodological paper provides a step-by-step guide of QCA and links the background theory of the method to its practical implementation, via an example in the business-to business (B2B) context of open and closed innovation. The paper provides practitioners and researchers alike with a clear roadmap on how to exploit the full potential of the method in order to derive insightful explanations in applied data analysis.},

Most of the literature has been optimistic on this score; while internal constraints (e.g. lack of managerial ability) or external constraints (e.g. discrimination from government) are identified, expansion is seen as an open-ended process. In other contributions this view has been severely criticized; some allege that the small producers are exploited through various mechanisms, others suggest that their road to expansion is blocked as a result of factors such as the pre-existence of very advanced technology, the control of large firms over product markets, or difficulties in access to raw materials. In discussing the arguments put forward in the debate, an attempt is made to assess their theoretical bases and examine the extent to which they are supported empirically. While most studies express explicitly or implicitly a definite view on the growth potential of small producers, such judgement is rarely based on a comprehensive examination of the context which determines this potential.},

  abstract = {The lack of senior female role models continues to be cited as a key barrier to women's career success. Yet there is little academic research into the gendered aspects of role modelling in organizations, or the utility of role models at a senior level. The paper starts with a review of papers examining the construction of role models in organizational settings. This leads to the inclusion of two related areas – organizational demographics as the contextual factor affecting the availability of role models and how they are perceived, and work identity formation as a possible key explanatory factor behind the link between the lack of senior female role models and the lack of career progression to top organizational levels. The literature looking at social theories of identity formation is then considered from a gender perspective. The key gaps identified are that while the behavioural value of role models has been well documented, a better understanding is needed of how gender and organizational demography influence the role modelling process. Importantly, the symbolic value and possibly other values of female role models in the identity construction of senior women require further in-depth investigation. Finally, this review calls for a more integrated approach to the study of role models and work identity formation, pulling together literatures on organizational demography, the cognitive construal of role models and their importance for successful work identity formation in senior women.},

  abstract = {This dissertation analyses how the policies of Suharto’s New Order government (1966-98) and post-Asian Financial Crisis reforms shaped Indonesian SME development. Indonesia featured as one of the high-growth Tiger Economies in the World Bank’s (1993) East Asian Miracle report. One of the features of the East Asian model is the ‘principle of shared growth’, implemented through various reforms, including SME-targeted support policies. Suharto restructured the Indonesian economy along similar lines, yet it is commonly argued that Indonesia suffered from a ‘missing middle’ - a gap in firm-size distribution due to small firms staying small and large firms being born already relatively large. This perceived inability of indigenous firms to grow is subject to recurrent heated public debate. Chapter 2 places indigenous entrepreneurship in historical context, showing that attempts to foster it during the late colonial and early post-independence period largely failed. Chapter 3 explores the question of the missing middle in the manufacturing sector despite the New Order government’s objective to strengthen small enterprises. Using Economic Census data on number of firms, workers and value added by firm-size category reveals that as the Indonesian economy grew a missing middle emerged and persisted. A comparison with South Korea and Taiwan shows that this could not be explained by Indonesia’s stage of economic development and is indicative of a dual economy. Chapter 4 focuses on access to credit, a main constraint to SME development. Using Bank Indonesia data and statistical yearbooks, I analyse the various small business credit schemes introduced since the early 1970s. These generally showed – at best – mixed results. I identify a turning point when the approach shifted from subsidised targeted government credit programmes to market-led financial intermediation by commercial and local rural banks with market interest rates on savings and loans. However, the vast majority of SMEs remained self-financed and access to credit continued to be a pervasive issue for Indonesian SMEs during the New Order period and beyond.},

We find empirical evidence that weak contract enforcement is associated with lower R\&D investment: R\&D intensity in an industry increases with the quality of the judicial system. This effect is particularly strong in industries that cannot buy inputs on competitive markets and thus depend more on contracts to acquire inputs. In line with this, we show that contract enforcement is particularly important in industries in which vertical integration is not a viable option.},

  abstract = {The laws that discriminate against women represent one of the most prevalent forms of gender inequality, hindering women’s empowerment and economic outcomes. In this regard, this paper sheds light on the relationship between legal constraints on women and various labour force outcomes. Based on a global sample of countries over 1970–2019, the results show that legal gender equality helps countries bridge the gender gap in labour force participation. More-gender equal laws (i) translate into a larger share of women in the workforce, and (ii) do not have a negative effect on that of men. As a result, legal gender equality also boosts labour force participation on aggregate. These patterns are long-lasting for upwards of 10~years. The findings point to a win-win situation: As countries repeal the laws that discriminate against women, which could be achievable in the shorter term, they can attain more inclusive and higher economic growth. This is even more important in the post-Covid-19 period, considering the adverse effects of the pandemic on gender inequality and economic growth.},

We also find that the type of credit—whether the loans are general purpose or for a specific purpose—is associated with economic growth in different ways. Overall, credit provided to the corporate sector by domestic private banks is correlated with higher economic growth rates. In contrast, the relationship between credit from state-owned banks and economic growth becomes statistically significant only after the crisis. Although we follow the finance-growth literature in our empirical exercises using internal instruments in generalized method of moments (GMM) estimations, we also conduct robustness tests using two additional external instruments: the number of complaints filed against each bank and local credit accessibility. Our findings with external instruments are the same with respect to the use of traditional internal instruments in GMM estimations.},

Shows that high growth can be achieved by firms with a variety of size, sector and age characteristics; such firms are distinguished more by the strategies and actions of managers than by their profile characteristics. The clearest differences between fast growth firms and other firms are with respect to their approach to product and market development. While high growth firms were above average investors they were not production‐led; instead they were characterized by an ability to make changes in production to complement an active market development strategy. To grow successfully over ten years, firms also needed to develop their internal organizational structure in ways that enabled the leader of the firm to delegate responsibility for operational tasks to become more focused on strategic level functions. Job generation was particularly concentrated in the high growth firms which also demonstrated an ability to increase labour productivity at the same time as they were increasing employment.},

Friederike Welter is Senior Researcher, 'Crafts and SMEs' Research Group, Rhine- Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI), Essen, Germany. The paper is concerned with the role of government in relation to SME development in economies at different stages of market reform. It demonstrates that, as in mature market economies, the state is a major factor influencing the nature and pace of SME development, although more through its influence on the external environment in which business activity can develop than through direct support measures or interventions. Survey evidence from the Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova suggests that many enterprises are set up, survive and sometimes even grow despite government, because of the creativity of individuals in mobilising resources and their flexibility in adapting to hostile external environments. The problem is that in these situations the number of firms remains small and their contribution to economic development rather limited. In such a context, government still has to create the framework conditions for private sector development to become embedded and sustaining. At the same time, in countries where market reforms are at a more advanced stage (such as Poland), current priorities for government with respect to the environment for SME development include bringing legislation and regulations in line with EU standards in preparation for EU accession, encouraging the banking system to adapt and recognise the SME sector as a potential market for a range of financial products, facilitating the development of venture capital funds for that minority of SMEs that seek external equity, and working in partnership with the private sector to establish an effective support infrastructure. Although there may be a case for selective interventions in both types of circumstances, direct support measures are not the main role for government in either case.},

  abstract = {The transitions literature emphasises the role of niches, defined as a protective space for path-breaking innovations. Surprisingly, the concept of protection has not been systematically interrogated. Our analysis identifies effective protection as having three properties in wider transition processes: shielding, nurturing and empowerment. Empowerment is considered the least developed in current niche literature. It can be understood as either processes that make niche innovations competitive within unchanged selection environments (fit-and-conform) or as processes that contribute to changes in mainstream selection environments in ways favourable to a path-breaking niche innovation (stretch-and-transform). Adopting a more constructivist perspective, we subsequently argue that analysis of these properties needs to be complemented with particular attention for the politics involved in their construction. Attention to empowerment confirms the view that niche actors need to link to wider processes of social change, and suggests how this arises. The paper ends with an outlook upon two promising research avenues: (1) the reconstruction of niche development in light of the present framework; (2) analyses of the diverse (political) narratives seeking to empower niches across time and space.},

This non-linear effect of financial deepening is driven by both investment credit and consumption credit. These results suggest that too much investment credit and, to a lesser extent, consumption credit are detrimental to economic growth.

  abstract = {Using a survey of 41,862 manufacturing firms in Indonesia from 2004 through 2013, this study documents that firms in provinces with deeper financial infrastructure exhibit better performance in general; but this is true especially for firms with higher financial constraints (measured by a low-intensity use of fixed capital), and only when financial depth at the province level already exceeds a certain level. That is, this paper documents the presence of firm-level and province-level thresholds in the nexus between financial deepening and firm performance. It is important to consider such conditioning factors, in addition to boosting financial development, in order to improve manufacturing firms' performance and thus industrialization in Indonesia.},

We study how drawing on the support of various stakeholders—specifically family, community, and business partners—helps overcome institutional voids and foster entrepreneurship in Indian microenterprises. We also examine how the adoption of digital technologies—e.g., in the form of smartphone apps—can strengthen those relationships. By surveying more than 1,000 microentrepreneurs in rural India, we find that both the families and communities (in particular self-help groups) of entrepreneurs have a positive and significant effect on entrepreneurship that is strengthened when digital technologies are used. Support from business partners, however, is negatively associated with entrepreneurship.},

It consists of all the interdependent actors and factors that enable and constrain entrepreneurship within a particular territory. Although growing in popularity, the entrepreneurial ecosystem concept remains loosely defined and measured. This paper shows the value of taking a systems view of the context of entrepreneurship: understanding entrepreneurial economies from a systems perspective. We use a systems framework for studying entrepreneurial ecosystems, develop a measurement instrument of its elements, and use this to compose an entrepreneurial ecosystem index to examine the quality of entrepreneurial ecosystems in the Netherlands. We find that the prevalence of high-growth firms in a region is strongly related to the quality of its entrepreneurial ecosystem. Strong interrelationships among the ecosystem elements reveal their interdependence and need for a systems perspective.},

  abstract = {Regional policies for entrepreneurship are currently going through a transition from increasing the quantity of entrepreneurship to increasing the quality of entrepreneurship. The next step will be the transition from entrepreneurship policy towards policy for an entrepreneurial economy. The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach has been heralded as a new framework accommodating these transitions. This approach starts with the entrepreneurial actor, but emphasizes the context of productive entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is not only the output of the system, entrepreneurs are important players themselves in creating the ecosystem and keeping it healthy. This research briefing reviews the entrepreneurial ecosystem literature and its shortcomings, and provides a novel synthesis. The entrepreneurial ecosystem approach speaks directly to practitioners, but its causal depth and evidence base is rather limited. This article provides a novel synthesis including a causal scheme of how the framework and systemic conditions of the ecosystem lead to particular entrepreneurial activities as output of the ecosystem and new value creation as outcome of the ecosystem. In addition it provides a framework for analysing the interactions between the elements within the ecosystem. This offers a much more rigorous and relevant starting point for subsequent studies into entrepreneurial ecosystems and the regional policy implications of these.},

Insight into these preceding transitions is necessary in order to increase the pool of potential high-growth firms and to target particular transitions in the path toward becoming a high-growth firm. Important enabling high-growth firm policies can be found in the areas of education policy and labor market policy. Even though these enabling policies are rather generic in nature, they can be made more effective by targeting particular groups that are more relevant for particular transitions toward becoming a high-growth firm. In addition, there are many targeted industrial policies and regional cluster policies that also have direct implications for the presence of high-growth firms. In order for local policies to be effective they should not conflict with national and supranational policies.},

  abstract = {This book is about learning from data using the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). GAMLSS extends the Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to accommodate large complex datasets, which are increasingly prevalent. In particular, the GAMLSS statistical framework enables flexible regression and smoothing models to be fitted to the data. The GAMLSS model assumes that the response variable has any parametric (continuous, discrete or mixed) distribution which might be heavy- or light-tailed, and positively or negatively skewed. In addition, all the parameters of the distribution (location, scale, shape) can be modelled as linear or smooth functions of explanatory variables.   Key Features:   Provides a broad overview of flexible regression and smoothing techniques to learn from data whilst also focusing on the practical application of methodology using GAMLSS software in R.    Includes a comprehensive collection of real data examples, which reflect the range of problems addressed by GAMLSS models and provide a practical illustration of the process of using flexible GAMLSS models for statistical learning.   R code integrated into the text for ease of understanding and replication.   Supplemented by a website with code, data and extra materials.   This book aims to help readers understand how to learn from data encountered in many fields. It will be useful for practitioners and researchers who wish to understand and use the GAMLSS models to learn from data and also for students who wish to learn GAMLSS through practical examples.},

Using a panel of 141 countries (93 developing and 48 developed), we attempt to explore and compare the impact of human capital on economic growth at different development stages. For our estimation, we employ the System Generalized Methods of Moments (SGMM) for the period 1980–2008. Our findings reveal that all aspects of human capital positively influence growth in developing countries, especially life expectancy gain, which may be explained by the demographic transition these countries are going through. However, the scenario is different for developed countries, where increased life expectancy posits a drag on economic growth, probably because of the increasingly aging population and dependency ratio. Only when life expectancy is omitted does health expenditure, along with other educational measures of human capital, help sustain growth in developed countries.},

This method allows them to study the determinants of the presence of a growth dynamics at the same time as the determinants of growth intensity. Findings The model shows that entrepreneurs play a weak role in understanding the growth trajectories of their company. Rather, it is organisational factors – such as the level of innovation and the governance structure – that explain initiation of a growth trajectory and the intensity of the growth. Originality/value By using an original methodology, the authors highlight the importance of organisational factors and encourage entrepreneurs to develop a governance structure focused on internal stakeholders to support growth.},

  abstract = {The dynamic capabilities framework analyzes the sources and methods of wealth creation and capture by private enterprise firms operating in environments of rapid technological change. The competitive advantage of firms is seen as resting on distinctive processes (ways of coordinating and combining), shaped by the firm's (specific) asset positions (such as the firm's portfolio of difficult-to-trade knowledge assets and complementary assets), and the evolution path(s) it has adopted or inherited. The importance of path dependencies is amplified where conditions of increasing returns exist. Whether and how a firm's competitive advantage is eroded depends on the stability of market demand, and the ease of replicability (expanding internally) and imitatability (replication by competitors). If correct, the framework suggests that private wealth creation in regimes of rapid technological change depends in large measure on honing internal technological, organizational, and managerial processes inside the firm. In short, identifying new opportunities and organizing effectively and efficiently to embrace them are generally more fundamental to private wealth creation than is strategizing, if by strategizing one means engaging in business conduct that keeps competitors off balance, raises rival's costs, and excludes new entrants.}

The systems approach received attention from management scholars in the middle of the last century, but, since then, has been largely abandoned. Meanwhile, academic disciplines have continued to narrow their focus. The capabilities and systems frameworks both adopt a holistic view that calls for all elements of an organization to be in alignment, and both recognize the importance of some form of learning for the purpose of adaptation. Dynamic capabilities go further by recognizing that organizations not only adapt to the business environment, they often try to shape it, too. While systems theory emphasizes internal stability over time and homogeneity across similar systems, dynamic capabilities include an explicit role for management/leadership that allows systemic change to start from within, which is the source of heterogeneity across firms. Dynamic capabilities are part of a system that includes resources and strategy. Together they determine the degree of competitive advantage an individual enterprise can gain over its rivals.},

  abstract = {Using a sample of 309 Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) from Tanzania and applying partial least square structural equation modeling, the study analyses the different effects of managers' general and specific human capital on SME innovation and productivity. The results demonstrate that top managers with higher education qualification place greater importance on non-technological innovation in comparison with their less educated peers. They further show that managers with more years of experience in the sector place higher importance on technological innovation than their less experienced counterparts. In addition, the results show that SMEs with managers who have higher education qualification achieve higher productivity than their less educated peers, with marketing innovation partially complementarily mediating this relationship. The effect of top managers' experience in the sector on SME productivity is shown to be insignificant. This paper uncovers the mediating role of marketing innovation on the relationship between top managers' human capital and SME productivity in Tanzania. Previous research did not consider the role of innovation as a means to translate top manager's human capital into firm productivity. These results help to provide some practical suggestions for managers, entrepreneurs and policy makers. This is a cross-sectional study which might not have captured all the effects of top managers' human capital fully.},

For Spanish manufactures in the period 2000-12 and through the use of a multilevel framework, we obtain that after controlling for the firm’s characteristics, the regional context has not only a direct effect on firms’ innovation performance, but it also conditions the returns to firms’ networking activities, although differently in the case of cooperation and outsourcing. Cooperating in innovation activities is more beneficial for those firms located in a knowledge intensive region, whereas R\&D outsourcing seems to be more profitable for firms in regions with a low knowledge pool.},

Market institutions would enhance such a relationship, and the credit and equity market development levels are beneficial to a country's innovation only up to a certain threshold.

  abstract = {In this paper we argue that inappropriate handling of technological heterogeneity distorts the benchmarking process eroding performance scores. Country- and industry-specific frontier studies have been the dominant approaches in explaining productivity differentials stating that heterogeneous performance patterns are attributed to different sources. However, studies bringing together the above approaches have not been surfaced yet. We fill that void by partitioning the metafrontier to account for alternative technological hierarchies. To disentangle the layers of complexity triggering heterogeneous performance, we introduce two types of heterogeneity each one referring to different stages of the performance evaluation process. To identify the Decision making unit-Specific Heterogeneity type, attached to each entity, we propose the w-ratio as a result of an iterative algorithm developed herein. In order to identify the Hierarchical Structural Heterogeneity type arising under alternative hierarchical structures, we define thresholds of heterogeneity. Using data on seventeen European countries and thirteen industries from manufacturing and transportation from 1999 through 2006 and employing a control function approach with one endogenous covariate, we find that the DSH and the HSH type are endogenously related via the role of the state dependence while the path dependence phenomenon is a major catalyst for future technological achievements and productivity improvements. Transition economies and fragmented industries exhibit persistent technological heterogeneity regardless of the technological structure adopted, since further development is mostly affected by past characteristics of the economic environment implying low subsequent competitiveness.},

  abstract = {Contrary to a simple model of small firm growth where increased inputs produce greater outputs, we consider growth is a complex and difficult process. Accordingly, the paper is concerned with how small firms grow, especially how they make sense of the growth process. We collected narratives of the experiences of small firm growth in an extended case study to draw out how growth is understood and managed. We saw how owners became entangled in the process of growing, especially where a change in one aspect led to problems in other dimensions of growth. Their narratives were about trying to make sense, and give some sense to the complexity of growth and some direction to what they should manage. We identified a repertoire of narrative forms: Growth is understood through output indicators, growth is treated as the internal development of the firm and finally, growth is taken to be inevitable - a necessity to which the firm has to conform. These illustrate how growth can be understood as processes of growing, bound up in the context, created in space and time, and contingent on how growth is understood and experienced. Far from a smooth trajectory, enacting growth reflects the experience of the moment, it is shaped by reactions rather than strategy and it is messy rather than ordered. This study contributes to the literature by complementing the functionalist and output oriented view by understanding firm growth as a social phenomenon constructed and reconstructed in the interactions between people and experiences of context.},

In countries with higher levels of GDP per capita, stock market development, legal systems and property rights, and lower levels of corruption, firms face lower levels of financial constraints.

Previous empirical examination of the link is based on aggregate GDP on the presumption that each economic sector responds identically to financial development. However, the extent of credit utilisation, as well as productivity of credit, may not necessarily remain the same across sectors. This study therefore seeks to contribute to the literature by examining the effect of financial development across sectors in sub-Saharan Africa using the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) over the period 1990–2018. Indeed, the findings show that while financial development has a positive effect on the service and agricultural sectors, a certain threshold of financial development must be reached before it can positively contribute to the growth of the industrial sector. The findings are robust to a different estimation technique. With the industrial sector considered critical for economic transformation, our findings imply that policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa need to continue to promote financial development to spur industrialization.},

To create sustainable and inclusive agrifood systems, investments in innovation and capacity-building are essential. Using a case study, this research examined the influence of gender dynamics on the adoption of cattle farming innovations in Indonesia. Despite substantial research on gender and innovation in developing countries, limited attention has been paid to this issue in the Indonesian context. To address this gap, we conducted focus group discussions and key informant interviews with female farmers and extension officers to identify the challenges that rural Indonesian women face in accessing cattle farming innovations. Our findings reveal that women's inclusion in innovation is constrained by multiple issues, such as the invisibility of their contributions, their limited influence in decision-making processes, and complex sociocultural and institutional factors that perpetuate the concept of gender harmony, which contributes to the subjugation of women. To promote gender equality and enhance rural well-being in Indonesia, we recommend for a comprehensive transformation of policy and institutional approaches to women's empowerment and the implementation of gender-transformative policies in the agricultural sector.},

  abstract = {Empirical studies in spatial economics have shown that agglomeration economies may be a source of the uneven distribution of economic activities and economic growth across cities and regions. Both localization and urbanization economies are hypothesized to foster agglomeration and growth, but recent meta-analyses of this burgeoning body of empirical research show that the results are ambiguous. Recent overviews show that this ambiguity is fueled by measurement issues and heterogeneity in terms of scale of time and space, aggregation, growth definitions and the functional form of the models applied. Alternatively, in this paper, we argue that ambiguity may be due to a lack of research on firm-level performance in agglomerations. This research is necessary because the theories that underlie agglomeration economies are microeconomic in nature. Hierarchical or multilevel modeling, which allows micro levels and macro levels to be modeled simultaneously, is becoming an increasingly common practice in the social sciences. As illustrated by detailed Dutch data on firm-level productivity, employment growth and firm survival, we argue that these approaches are also suitable for reducing the ambiguity surrounding the agglomeration–firm performance relationship and for addressing spatial, sectoral and cross-level heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {How do firms adapt? In recent years, this old question has attracted new answers—albeit partial ones. On the one hand, cognition researchers have emphasized managerial attention to environmental change as a key driver of adaptation. On the other hand, dynamic capabilities scholars have underscored the role of asset reconfigurations implemented amid shifting environments. However, the explanatory powers of the two perspectives have not yet been assessed comparatively. This mixed methods study uses fuzzy-set analyses of defense firms’ responses to 9/11 to model the two perspectives as potentially competing or complementary, while our findings suggest that neither dynamic capabilities nor superior cognition must be present for firms to adapt. Instead, we identify four types of adapters (anticipative, responsive, opportunistic, and decisive), as well as the possibility of strategic non-adaptation. These results lead us to reassess the cognition and capabilities literatures and to outline a new, integrative framework to explain adaptation.},

L'auteur maintient, que sous un équilibre statique à longue vue, les coûts marginaux et les coûts moyens doivent être uniformes pour chaque producteur. Les différentes conditions qui prévalent sous une longue vue sont discutées dans une section concluante, traitant de courbes de dépenses particulières. It is the primary purpose of this article to develop a graphical exposition of the manner in which supply curves are dependent upon the different possible types of technological and pecuniary cost situations, under the usual assumptions of atomistic competition and of rational economic behaviour on the part of the producers. The author begins in each case with the mode of adjustment of a particular concern to the given market situation when the industry as a whole is supposed to be in equilibrium. The cases such discussed are short and long run equilibrium, increasing and constant costs, net internal economies (and diseconomies) of large scale production. Also the external economies (and diseconomies) are treated in detail. The author maintains that under long run static equilibrium marginal costs and average costs must be uniform for each producer. Different conditions prevailing under short run are discussed in a concluding section on particular expenses curves.}

If we want to avoid branding the young people as a “Lost Generation”, we need to act quickly. One important active labor market strategy to solve the youth unemployment crisis is entrepreneurship, helping them turn into job creators rather than job seekers. Entrepreneurship has received significant attention over the past decade with a rapid and often uncoordinated increase in entrepreneurship support programs. These constitute a major part of entrepreneurship ecosystems. In order to build effective entrepreneurship ecosystems, we need to understand the components and assessment indices of such ecosystems. This essay proposes a new conceptual framework describing entrepreneurship ecosystems. The proposed framework is expected to support policymakers and practitioners in setting up new entrepreneurship ecosystems and serve as a basis for future research.},

  abstract = {Using unique innovation survey data collected from a homogenous sample of firms in Pakistan, this paper presents an analysis of the firm level determinants of product innovation and its impact on firm performance. We employ a multi-stage structural model linking the decision of a firm to innovate, its innovation investment, product innovation, and firm performance using primary data from the textile and wearing apparel sector, which is the largest export sector of Pakistan. We find that product innovation leads to increased labor productivity as well as higher labor productivity growth. A 10 percent increase in innovative sales per worker is associated with a greater than 10 percent increase in labor productivity and labor productivity growth. On the determinants of innovation, we find that vertical knowledge flows from foreign clients and suppliers are important determinants of a firm's decision to innovate. Larger firms are more likely to engage in innovation, however, there is no significant evidence that they invest more in innovation. Exporting is positively associated with innovation performance and firms exporting to Europe and America are more likely to engage in innovation. There is mixed evidence on the impact of competition: foreign competition adversely affects a firm’s decision to innovate, whereas, local competition increases investment in innovation. Subsidies seem to have a crowding out effect since firms receiving national subsides invest less in innovation. Furthermore, firms that have higher investment in innovation, that are more productive, and that introduce organizational innovations have higher innovative sales per worker.},

This includes the frameworks used to analyse production, the division of labour and its application to the firm and the development of the neoclassical model of production.The first topic explored is the change from a normative approach to a largely positive approach to the analysis of the theory of production, which occurred around the seventeenth century. The next topic is an examination of the relationship (or the lack of a relationship) between the division of labour and the theory of the firm. In the fourth chapter, the focus is on the development of the proto-neoclassical approach to production. Here, the development of the theories of monopoly, oligopoly and perfect competition are discussed, as well as the theory of input utilisation. Chapter 5 looks at Marshall’s idea of the representative firm, which was the main early neoclassical approach to the theory of industry-level production. The penultimate chapter considers the criticisms made of the neoclassical model between 1940 and 1970. This work is an illuminating reference for students and researchers of the history of economic thought, industrial organisation, microeconomic theory and organisational studies.},

The strategy formulated should be complemented by a firm's resource‐based capabilities. Firms that do not match their strategy and resources could lead to unfocused and unproductive efforts. Evidence shows that the “fit” between resource‐based capabilities and strategy partially affects the venture performance.

The methodologies employed are Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Accidental or fortuitous events, quantifiable, numerous and homogeneous, and evaluable are used as causal conditions, and 76 construction risks from previous studies are used as cases, with construction risk insurability as the outcome. The NCA revealed varying levels of necessity for insurable risks, with consistency levels ranging from 0.541 to 0.631 and uninsurable risks, with consistency levels from 0.863 to 0.980. The fsQCA identified multiple sufficient conditions for insurable (consistency = 0.881, coverage = 0.762) and uninsurable risks (consistency = 0.825, coverage = 0.924) and highlighted causal asymmetry. Core conditions for insurable and uninsurable risks were identified, and configurations for insurable and uninsurable risks differed between insurers and contractors. However, compromised configurations with aggregate data exhibited satisfactory consistency levels for both groups, with consistency exceeding 0.80. The findings of this study advance the understanding of risk insurability, thereby minimizing conflicts between insurers and contractors, which are the main targets of this study. Several limitations are acknowledged, which can guide future research.},

Limited competition in the banking sector causes a high loan-deposit spread, worsens the initial effect of corruption, and depresses growth. Fostering bank competition, for instance, by allowing foreign bank entry, would be a simple solution to this problem, but frequently, authorities choose to hamper bank competition. Therefore, we explain the persistence of non-competitive banking as a result of governments’ regulatory choice. If the government has a stake in the banking sector there exists a trade-off between current benefits from bank profits and future growth. Firm-level corruption affects intertemporal optimization and distorts the government’s choice towards more restrictive regulation, i.e., less bank competition, even if the deciding institution itself is not corrupt. These results show that the two prominent problems for small and medium enterprises, corruption and finance, are mutually reinforcing.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on small business managers’ motivation to expand their firms. More specifically, we examine the relationships between expected consequences of growth on the one hand, and overall attitude toward growth on the other. Data were collected in three separate studies over a ten–year period using the same measuring instrument. The results suggest that noneconomic concerns may be more important than expected financial outcomes in determining overall attitude toward growth. In particular, the concern for employee well–being comes out strongly. We interpret this as reflecting a concern that the positive atmosphere of the small organization may be lost in growth. We conclude that this concern may be a cause for recurrent conflict for small business managers when deciding about the future route for their firms.},

Although conceived primarily as an approach to the descriptive analysis of the firm and industry, evolutionary economics offers a distinctive view of the firm that is adaptable for the purposes of normative analysis (Winter 1987). The resource-based view, as it has been developed in the strategy literature, seeks to derive normative guidance for business decision making from a deeper understanding of the sources of interfirm profitability differences (Wernerfelt 1984; Rumelt 1984). It interprets these as reflections of differences in streams of rents and quasi-rents accruing to firms, which in turn are attributed to differences in the control and management of strategic resources.},

  abstract = {The transition from an industrial economy to an innovation economy poses two critical questions for the manufacturing sector in advanced countries. First, given the diffusion of modern manufacturing practices around the world, what level of innovation (incremental, more far-ranging, or radical) is most likely to support a resilient domestic manufacturing sector? Second, are assumed differences in the innovative capacity across space likely to hasten the decline of rural manufacturing? To answer these questions this research combines comprehensive measures of self-reported innovation able to reliably differentiate incremental and more far-ranging innovation with establishment-level data able to examine the geographical distribution of these different innovation strategies. The data used for the analysis includes a two-period panel of manufacturing establishments surveyed in 1996 and 2013 with annual employment data indicating survival in the intervening years. Our findings suggest that long-surviving manufacturing plants overwhelmingly gravitate away from non-innovation strategies toward incremental or more far-ranging innovation orientations. A survival advantage of far-ranging innovation over incremental innovation is observed for standalone firms. We do not identify a difference in the innovation orientations of rural and urban manufacturing establishments.},

  abstract = {This essay elaborates on the usefulness of embracing complexity theory, modeling outcomes rather than directionality, and modeling complex rather than simple outcomes in strategic management. Complexity theory includes the tenet that most antecedent conditions are neither sufficient nor necessary for the occurrence of a specific outcome. Identifying a firm by individual antecedents (i.e., non-innovative versus highly innovative, small versus large size in sales or number of employees, or serving local versus international markets) provides shallow information in modeling specific outcomes (e.g., high sales growth or high profitability)—even if directional analyses (e.g., regression analysis, including structural equation modeling) indicates that the independent (main) effects of the individual antecedents relate to outcomes directionally—because firm (case) anomalies almost always occur to main effects. Examples: a number of highly innovative firms have low sales while others have high sales and a number of non-innovative firms have low sales while others have high sales. Breaking-away from the current dominant logic of directionality testing—null hypotheses statistic testing (NHST)—to embrace somewhat precise outcome testing (SPOT) is necessary for extracting highly useful information about the causes of anomalies—associations opposite to expected and “statistically significant” main effects. The study of anomalies extends to identifying the occurrences of four-corner strategy outcomes: firms doing well in favorable circumstances, firms doing badly in favorable circumstances, firms doing well in unfavorable circumstances, and firms doing badly in unfavorable circumstances. Models of four-corner strategy outcomes advances strategic management beyond the current dominant logic of directional modeling of single outcomes.},

  abstract = {This essay describes tenets of complexity theory including the precept that within the same set of data X relates to Y positively, negatively, and not at all. A consequence to this first precept is that reporting how X relates positively to Y with and without additional terms in multiple regression models ignores important information available in a data set. Performing contrarian case analysis indicates that cases having low X with high Y and high X with low Y occur even when the relationship between X and Y is positive and the effect size of the relationship is large. Findings from contrarian case analysis support the necessity of modeling multiple realities using complex antecedent configurations. Complex antecedent configurations (i.e., 2 to 7 features per recipe) can show that high X is an indicator of high Y when high X combines with certain additional antecedent conditions (e.g., high A, high B, and low C)—and low X is an indicator of high Y as well when low X combines in other recipes (e.g., high A, low R, and high S), where A, B, C, R, and S are additional antecedent conditions. Thus, modeling multiple realities—configural analysis—is necessary, to learn the configurations of multiple indicators for high Y outcomes and the negation of high Y. For a number of X antecedent conditions, a high X may be necessary for high Y to occur but high X alone is almost never sufficient for a high Y outcome.},

The theory and data analysis tests key propositions in complexity theory: (1) no single antecedent condition is a sufficient or necessary indicator of a high score in an outcome condition; (2) a few of many available complex configurations of antecedent conditions are sufficient indicators of high scores in an outcome condition; (3) contrarian cases occur, that is, low scores in a single antecedent condition associates with both high and low scores for an outcome condition for different cases; (4) causal asymmetry occurs, that is, accurate causal models for high scores for an outcome condition are not the mirror opposites of causal models for low scores for the same outcome condition. The study tests and supports these propositions in the context of customer assessments (n=436) of service facets and service outcome evaluations for assisted temporary-transformations of self via beauty salon and spa treatments. The findings contribute to advancing a nuanced theory of how customers' service evaluations relate to their assessments of overall service quality and intentions to use the service. The findings support the need for service managers to be vigilant in fine-tuning service facets and service enactment to achieve the objective of high customer retention.},

This is a novel approach that examines the integrated effect of the entrepreneurial ecosystem's political–legal subsystem on the performance of MSEs based on system theory and the mediating role of entrepreneurial competence taking a resource-based view in to account. There has been no detailed examination of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of MSEs in Africa in general, and Ethiopia in particular. A total sample of 499 MSE operators engaged in the three priority sectors: manufacturing, construction and urban agriculture was selected from the population of 4086 operators in three metropolitan cities of Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia, using a proportional stratified sampling. Though the political–legal aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystem have a major impact on both entrepreneurial competency and MSE’s performance, the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and MSE performance was found to be insignificant. The role of entrepreneurial competency in mediating the relationships between policy and business performance and other business environments and business performance was shown to be insignificant. It is suggested by the study that the policies that the government designs concerning MSEs should be workable and attractive including the provision of different incentives. Lastly, other researchers in the area are suggested to further clarify the contradictions in the findings regarding the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and the performance of SMEs.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the correlation between firm size, growth and profitability along with other firm-specific variables (like leverage, competition and asset tangibility), macroeconomic variable (like GDP growth-business cycle) and stock market development variable (like MCR). Design/methodology/approach Using the COMPUSTAT Global database this work uses panel dynamic fixed effects model for nearly 12,001 unique non-financial listed and active firms from 1995 to 2016 for 12 industrial and emerging Asia–Pacific economies. This interrelationship was also examined for small, medium and large size companies classified based on three alternate measures such as total assets, net sales and MCR of firms. Findings The persistence of profits coefficient was found to be positive and modest. There is evidence of a negative size-profitability and positive growth-profitability relationship suggesting that initially profitability increases with the growth of the firm but eventually, overtime, gains in profit rates reduce, as size increases indicting that large size breeds inefficiency. The relationship between firm's leverage ratio and its asset tangibility is found to be negative with profitability. The business cycle and stock market development variables suggest a positive relationship with the profitability of firms. However, the significance of estimated coefficients was mixed and varied among different selected Asia–Pacific economies. Practical implications The study has economic implications on issues such as industrial concentration, risk and optimum size of firms for practicing managers of modern enterprise in emerging markets. Originality/value The analysis of the relationship between the firm size, growth and profitability is uniquely determined under a dynamic panel fixed effects framework using firm-specific variables along with macroeconomic and financial development determinants of profitability. This relationship is estimated for a large and new data set of 12 industrial and emerging Asia–Pacific economies. 研究目的 本研究擬探討公司的規模、成長和盈利能力之間的關係， 同時亦涵蓋公司特有的其它變量 （如愩杆作用， 競爭和資產的有形性）， 宏觀經濟變量 （如國內生產總值增長與景氣之循環）， 以及股市發展變量 (如MCR) 。 研究的設計/方法/理念 本研究以COMPUSTAT 全球資料庫、使用動態面板固定效應模型，涵蓋幾近12001間獨特的、非金融上市及活躍的公司、覆蓋期由1995年至2016年，涉及12個工業及新興的亞太經濟體。這相互關係分析研究亦於大、中及小型企業內進行，而這些企業就規模方面的分類是基於三個交替的測量而釐定的，如總資產、銷售淨額、以及企業的MCR。 研究結果 研究發現、利潤係數的持續性是正且適中不強的。有證據顯示、規模的大小與盈利能力是負相關的，而增長與盈利能力則為正相關；這暗示盈利能力初時會因企業的成長而增強，但隨著時間的推移最终當規模增大、利潤率的增長會下降，這提示我們：大的規模會導致效率低下。企業的杠桿比率與其資產有形性的關聯被發現與盈利能力成負相關。經濟週期及股市發展變量暗示與企業的盈利能力之關聯為正相關。唯估計係數的意義會因被挑選之各個不同亞太經濟體而有異和不統一的。 實際的意義 本研究對在新興市場的現代企業內工作的業務經理有其實際作用，因研究為他們在業務問題如產業集中度、危機、公司的最佳規模等問題上提供了經濟方面的啟示。 研究的原創性/價值 本研究分析公司規模、成長與其盈利能力的關係時，獨特之處是採用了動態面板固定效應模型，並於應用盈利能力的宏觀經濟和金融發展的決定因素的同時，也使用了企業特有的變量。而這關係的分析研究涵蓋12個工業及新興的亞太經濟體的龐大且新的數據集。},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate the relationship between firm size and growth under the framework of Law of Proportionate Effect (LPE) for Asian firms. Design/methodology/approach An unbalanced panel data for about 12,001 unique non-financial listed and active firms from 1995 to 2016 for 12 industrial and emerging Asian economies was examined. Total assets and net sales were used as size variables. Firm-specific variables such as return on equity, leverage and liquidity ratio were used along with macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth and two financial development indicators. The fixed effects and random effects approach were used to estimate the dynamic growth model after taking into account econometric issues such as correlation between the cross-country-specific error component and the regressors and heteroscedasticity. Findings The estimated coefficient of firm size was found to be always significant and negative rejecting the Gibrat’s law for Asian firms confirming that the small-sized firms are growing faster than larger-sized firms. Also, the persistence of growth coefficient suggested that a positive persistence of firm growth does not exist for the selected Asian firms. Gibrat’s LPE was also rejected across small, medium- and large-sized companies. For the aggregate sample, the coefficient of leverage was found to be negative and significant, whereas liquidity ratio, GDP growth, banking sector and stock market variables are found to have positive and significant relationship with growth of firms. For individual economies, a mix of positive and negative (significant and insignificant) estimated coefficient was observed. Practical implications At macro-level, the examination of firm growth is likely to have significant policy implications for the regulators and various government agencies as firm growth may increase economic activity in general and employment opportunities in particular. The policymakers can control economic and employment activity by designing specific firm growth policies. At micro-level, the study will have significant implications for managerial decision-making. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to test the validity of Gibrat’s LPE for large Asian economies and firms using recent data under a dynamic growth framework using firm-specific and macroeconomic variables. Also, persistence of growth of firms under LPE (that growth does not persist from one period to the next) is uniquely examined for Asian firms.},

  abstract = {China plays a significant role in the global product supply chain through its exports. To remain competitive, Chinese firms need to manufacture products cost-effectively. Revamping innovative cities can contribute to this goal, but empirical evidence in this area is limited. Therefore, this paper scrutinizes the innovative city pilot policy’s consequences on firms’ export performance and product quality. We employ the time-varying Difference in Difference (DID) model and harness a comprehensive firm-by-product level database to estimate the co-movement between the pilot intervention and the performance of the export product. Based on the findings, we unveil that a smart intervened city can significantly boost firms’ export product quality, which still holds after multiple robustness checks. Furthermore, innovative cities heighten the quality of the manufactured products when we consider firm-level (i.e., private, foreign, and ordinary trade enterprises), industry-level (i.e., low-polluting, capital-intensive, and technology-intensive industries), and regional (i.e., Middle, and Western regions) heterogeneities. In addition, the intervened smart city strategy impacts the efficacy of export product quality through policy and innovation-driven effects. Over and above, policymakers and experts should support state-of-the-art ideas while considering local conditions, providing guidance for decision-making in China’s innovative development strategy.},

  abstract = {We study the effects of different types of obstacles to innovation on the probability of obtaining different firm-level innovation outcomes. We consider financial, knowledge, cooperation, regulatory and demand-related obstacles, which we separate into two categories: market structure and lack or uncertainty about demand. Using a pooled sample of four Chilean innovation surveys and an instrumental variables approach novel to this literature to address endogeneity, we find that only demand and financial barriers seem to have a negative effect on the probability of generating innovations. When financial or demand barriers are present, they seem to be binding and take prevalence over all other obstacles, and when they are absent, other barriers become significant. We provide evidence of heterogeneous effects on different sectors, considering not only manufacturing and services but also primaries, a comparison that has not been previously conducted and holds relevance for developing economies. We show that knowledge obstacles are relevant to manufacturing and market structure and regulatory obstacles are relevant in the services sector, while demand and financial obstacles appear to matter across the board. The pervasiveness of financial and demand obstacles, their relationship with the remaining barriers, and the observed sectoral differences have important policy implications.},

  abstract = {Corporate entrepreneurship is important for organizational survival, profitability, growth, and renewal. Data from 127 Fortune 500 companies show that executive stock ownership and long-term institutional ownership are positively associated with such entrepreneurship. Conversely, short-term institutional ownership is negatively associated with it, as is a high ratio of outside directors on a company's board. Outside directors' stock ownership somewhat mitigates the latter negative association. Outsiders, including stock owners, might lead companies away from internal product development, the traditional route to corporate entrepreneurship. Finally, an industry's technological opportunities moderate the associations observed between corporate governance and ownership variables and corporate entrepreneurship.}

This paper employed fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method to explore how different combinations of factors link to the high-quality industrial development. Based on the results of the configuration path analysis, this paper recognized three configuration paths suitable for Xiamen’s industrial high-quality development, including high-quality industrial development mainly based on the domestic general cycle path, domestic and international dual cycle of industrial high-quality development path, and outward-oriented path of high-quality industrial development path. In the context of the economic new normal and high-quality development, this paper focuses on the influence mechanism of industrial high-quality development in Xiamen provides new empirical evidence for the government to formulate the relevant policy.},

  abstract = {Does bribery help or hurt firm growth? Some suggest that bribery greases the wheel of commerce, while others believe that bribery sands the wheel of growth. We argue that firms endogenously choose their level of bribery according to their environments and that the benefits and costs may differ for different types of bribery. Specifically, small firms are more likely to be forced to engage in bribery, while big firms may strategically engage in bribery. Utilizing a large, cross-country survey sample involving 2,686 firms in 48 countries, we find that firms choose a higher level of bribery when embedded in under-developed market-supporting institutions. After controlling for endogenous bribery choices, bribery hurts firm growth for small and medium-sized firms, but not for large firms.},

  abstract = {Whereas the damage of bribery on economic development is well recognized, controversy exists regarding whether it can benefit firm-level performance. By integrating the “grease” and “sand” views of bribery, this study offers the novel proposition that even though bribery may provide a means to deal with institutional voids, such that it fosters firms’ short-term performance (i.e., sales growth), it hinders long-term performance reflected in market capitalization. Moreover, the positive effect of bribery on sales growth decreases and its negative impact on market capitalization increases when the level of institutional development is higher. A longitudinal data set of Chinese listed firms lends strong support to our predictions, which in turn offer novel insights into bribery and its performance implications.},

However, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face difficulty in comprehensively implementing all recommended Human Resource Management (HRM) functions. In this study, we shed light on the field of HRM in SMEs by focusing on the context of Greek Small and Medium-sized Hotels (SMHs), which represent a dominant private sector employer across the country.~Design/methodology/approach-Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and 34 indepth interviews with SMHs' owners/managers, we explore the HRM conditions leading to high levels of performance, while taking into consideration the influence of internal key determinants.~Findings-We uncover three alternative successful HRM strategies that maximize business performance, namely the Compensation-based performers, the HRM developers and the HRM investors. Each strategy fits discreet organizational characteristics related to company size, ownership type and organizational structure.~Originality/value-To the best of the authors' knowledge this is among the first empirical studies that examine different and equifinal performance-enhancing configurations of HRM practices in SMHs.

It was found that both asset and employee could be well fitted with power-law distribution, even firms were classified in different industries. Meanwhile, the growth rate distribution has a Laplace form, which is estimated by Subbotin family function, and it is also robust when firms are in categories. By analyzing annual logarithmic growth rates, we can see that the standard deviation has a power-law shape on both asset and employee, as researchers have found in western countries. In addition, there exists a power-law dependence of the standard deviation on the age of firms, which means that the growth of firms also rely on the years that they have opened.},
