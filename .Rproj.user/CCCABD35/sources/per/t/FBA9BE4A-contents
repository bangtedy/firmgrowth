## Background {.scrollable}

Economists and policymakers are interested in studying the potential determinants of economic growth and mechanisms through which the most significant benefit can be achieved.

Most countries that have aimed for sustained rapid growth have maintained impressive public investment rates in three key areas: infrastructure, education, and health. 

- To increase standards of living --- 

## Firm growth and economic growth

Two historical circumstances have indirectly inspired this research on broadening the understanding of the relationship between economic growth and firm growth. 

- firm growth and decline is at the core of economic dynamics.
- Firm growth provides “prosperity” and “opportunity”.

## Masukkan kasus ASEAN {.scrollable}

Southeast Asia - the globe’s richest biologically. 

- The first is that some countries have achieved enormous growth rates due to firm growth. 
- The COGAD has identified five characteristics common to these 13 high-growth economies, including one factor thought to be especially crucial: a high rate of savings and investment (Spence, 2008) --- ini ke perusahaan.
- The second circumstance inspiring this thesis is that the evidence remains inconclusive, as 
confirmed by an in-depth review of the existing empirical literature, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.

- Given the evident lack of consensus in the existing literature, it is imperative to 
summarise this conflict...quote some studies.
- employment from firm
- firm contribution to GDP

## Thus

- From the results of this empirical literature, the influence of various factors on firm growth varies from one country to another...thus configurational.

- Three key factors have been studied extensively for their potential influence on firm growth.

## Tumbuh darimana?

- fraumeni

## Production and economic growth

Production allows us to satisfy more wants with the resources available --- nature doesn't automatically satisfy all of our needs and wants.

It creates more values by changing, manipulating and improving what nature provide. The better we become at production, the more and better suited the means that are available to us.

- This is what `economic growth` means.

## PPC and capitalist dynamics 

![](images/ppf.png){width=80% fig-align="left"}

- Growth requires increases in quantity and quality of input
- Growth requires conditions and specific types of resources and capabilities
- Firm growth requires flexibility to make changes in technology, workforce composition, product, location.

## Research agenda

Despite the difficulty imagining a modern economy without firm, the results of the current literature on the firm growth still vary between countries, which makes this field intriguing. 

This variation of results strongly prompted several questions about the conditions behind this and created a strong desire to examine the conditions closely and, most importantly, investigate the potential "causes of effects" of firm growth.

## Aims

The key objective of this thesis is to provide a deeper understanding of the 
configurations of some conditions and firm growth.

In particular, this research aims to answer the following three research questions: 

- Does a correlation exist between a more robust financial sector and 
stable long-term economic growth? 

translate into equifinality, asymmetry, etc

## Benefits/contribution

Adding further empirical evidence to this nexus is quite essential; however, examining the factors that may erode or promote this relationship is more imperative. 

Discussing such factors justifies why the results vary between countries and assists policymakers in addressing issues that might erode this substantial influence before conducting national development plans to promote the financial sector. 

## Contribution

This thesis builds on the literature by creating and refining a broad and up-to-date new database based on the availability of relevant data to assess the relationship between financial development and economic growth and adds further evidence regarding financial development effects on economic growth.

## Limitation

Like most literature, limitations in data availability exist for some variables, such as the financial sector depth and informal institution dataset. 

Despite these concerns, this thesis created and refined a broad and up-to-date new database based 
on the availability of relevant data. 

## Previous empirical works

With the availability of representative and comprehensive data sets --- much work has been done.

- Regressions: 
  + The growth rate of a firm as *dependent variable*, 
  + Attempts were made to explain this rate in terms of a long list of other variables.

## Results

Confirmed:

  + The heterogeneity of firm
  +  Firm growth is highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict
  
- Discovered empirical regularities: the growth rate distributions follow a "tent-shaped" pattern.

## Motivation

- The core motivation for this thesis is the importance of economic growth for 
general human well-being.
- The second motivation is the importance of the firm


## Theoretical framework {.scrollable}

**Neoclassic**. Using the marginal calculation to explain actions of firms. It follows that specifically understood marginal cost is employed in order to represent optimization decisions from the point of view of the firm. Notwithstanding the market structure –  be it perfect competition, monopolistic competition or monopoly –  the firm acts according to the same neoclassical scheme of profit maximization presented by the point where the gradients of the marginal cost and the marginal revenue are equal.

- *The black-box* firm of equilibrium price theory with the famous  $MR=MC$ rule. 
- The MC curve has a specific U- shape reflecting the variability. In the neo-classical scheme, what inhibits further production expansion are the increasing costs resulting from increasing the production. Meanwhile, as indicated by the research, many managers report in surveys that the factors inhibiting their further expansion.
- Apparently it is not solely the marginal cost that makes firms to go into the standby position. 
- Then we can see that in the real economy the black box is not controlled by the force of MC = MR, but by something more fundamental.

## profit maximization: can it be considered the firm’s objective? {.scrollable}

An inherent part of the scheme of equalizing marginal costs with marginal revenues constitutes a behavioral assumption concerning the rule of profit maximization (or “loss minimization” – in a short period profit maximization may bring the highest, though still negative profit). The greatest confusion in this approach is related to its formalization. 

Namely, in order for something to be really “maximized”, one must have full knowledge of the phenomenon analyzed, that is, they must know a closed mathematical presentation. 

Only then can we meet the condition of reaching the maxima. In neoclassical approach it is possible because we assume knowledge of the demand function and cost function. Thanks to this, the gradients of MC and MR can be equaled. 

Let us start with a marginal revenue curve that is based on the knowledge of the demand function and possibility of plotting such a precise curve. Exclusive hard data used by firms concern sales statistics in various time intervals. They are historical data; however, they do not form a true demand curve but merely its one point at a single given time. The demand curve may be stable over time when it concerns preferences at a given time and only this point may become a historical fact. Therefore, any facts that an enterprise may establish historically are merely different points of different demand curves.

In practice, firms use many tools to generate an approximate version of a demand curve. Surveys, focus groups, market research, reports on other firms’ data and firms generating related products are the tools aiming at establishing the demand curve for a given time (or something of the sort). However, one 
must keep in mind that such a curve cannot be generated for future events nor constitute a solid scientific forecast on future interest among customers. In other words, the demand curve is always forecasted, even for the past. It also concerns more stable conditions.

Without knowledge of MC and MR curves as available options (even probabilistic), one cannot talk about one existing parameter in the company that is then maximized. Of course, in economics, words can have very different meanings, but when treating such concept mathematically, the parameter of 
making a profit is not available in the form of data, hence using it as a form of decision-making compass is misdirected. Allocation and entrepreneurial decisions on part of the firm are speculative and constitute an attempt to discover the appropriate but not yet realized scenario. The firm has a range of available options and implements something like Simon’s “satisfying” strategy instead of maximization because it has to do with different goals, not necessarily limited to a simple and well-known comparative standard (Simon 1956)

Stating that a firm in a decision makes MR and MC equal seems to be completely out of place with the actual picture of the functioning enterprise. On the one hand, it is something that seems to reflect the core of the neoclassical message hidden in maximizing profits rule, but on the other hand we do not give up on a realistic approach to the analysis of the firm’s activities, because we do not downplay the context of uncertain future and speculative nature of allocation decisions

**Real firms**

  - Enact strategies, manage the creation and acquisition of information and knowledge, and that have internal organisational structures and processes.

## What is a firm?

A techno-functional entity

- as a black box that transforms factor inputs into outputs---how production and cost functions interact with demand on the market, i.e. the emphasis is on technical matters and how firms function in the context of the market.

An institutional entity

- identity, internal structure and external boundaries (Hodgson, 2002)

## Firm growth {.scrollable}

- One of the most burning topics concerning the firm is its size.
- what exactly the “size” of a firm is:
  + The firm’s impact can certainly be demonstrated by the total turnover, thus, the organizational unit’s ability to generate revenues.
  + the firm’s perspectives or rather their current perception, we can have a look at its capitalization (market value). It reflects the expectations that the firm may start to generate income sometime 
in the future 
  + From the social point of view, a more important factor deciding of the firm’s 
size may be the number of its employees. 
- until you reach it as a matter of degree

## What is expansion? {.scrollable}

It seems that the size of a firm can expand on different levels depending on the activity the company takes over. The first category would be intra-industry expansion. It would consist primarily of taking over its competitors by means of direct acquisition or winning rivalry for customers. 

The other category would be chain expansion.

Extra-industry expansion, entering other markets that are further from the original one. They may be more or less adjacent markets. The boundary of this classification is **a matter of degree**.

This classification into various types of companies’ expansions immediately suggests some hints as to what barriers a company may inevitably come across, when trying to enter markets other than its current one. 

## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.scrollable}

Why then the emerging barriers to the growth of firms appear? Are they 
transaction costs? The answer is both affirmative and negative. As it has been 
demonstrated, a lot depends on how these costs are understood and how 
much we try to match observed reality with the conceptual scheme adopted. 
In the light of the aforementioned directions of the firm’s expansion, a 
question may arise as to why the expansion is stopped in specific directions 
(not in general).

- The answer lies within the borders of the competitive advantage of such a company. 

This requirement of resources and capital, which would allow 
for running separate management and production processes, puts a significant 
limitation on the intra-industry expansion of many firms. They are not able to 
attract customers of other suppliers because each of them brings to the con-
sumer market something unique that cannot be easily replicated.

## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.scrollable}

This type of expansion has its own limitations that can be manifested either 
when creating new departments in the firm or when taking over other firms. 
Various factors may include the incompatibility of management systems, for 
example, different and limited computer systems (related to sales, accounting, 
inventory etc.), internal and control procedures (especially important for 
franchises). An analogous issue concerns human resources management that can 
constitute the greatest challenge. There are known cases of hostility of various 
teams from other firms that, when merging two independent entities, begin to 
be hostile towards each other.

In the case of non-intra-industry expansion, that is, when the firm enters 
secondary and farther markets (in case of both chain expansion and one that 
takes place completely outside the industry), the limitations seem to be even 
wider than those relating to intra- industry expansion.

## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.scrollable}

As it can be seen, all forms of expansion by the firm are accompanied by the risk of many drag chains that make it impossible. However, if we were to point out the strongest factors determining the obstacles, there would be three interrelated ones: (1) uncertainty, (2) competition and (3) lack of path dependence in the accumulation of capital. Uncertainty determines the inevitability of making mistakes in every action undertaken, as it has already been explained. 

Competition means that there are always other entrepreneurs in markets who, in the environment of uncertainty, will succeed and fail at the same time as others do, interchangeably. And finally, the third decisive factor: there is no guarantee that past successes improve the decision-making of firms in subsequent rounds.

## The message

- A central message presented in this research is that in discussing firm growth requires both techno-functional and institutional foundations.
- A firm as a techno-functional entity implies an ability to hire, buy and organise factors of production and contract for the sale of output. 
- This hiring, buying, organising and contracting implies a pre-existing institutional structure covering, for instance, legal and accounting systems. 
- Firm is complex heterogeneous
- Firm gorwth is gradation
- 

## two distinct institutional views

- the firm as a governance structure and the firm as a locus of strategic control. 
- The governance perspective is driven by issues of efficient motivation, the strategic approach by issues of long-run focus. 

## An implication of the framework developed here

- is that no universal status can be claimed for any particular theoretical perspective, i.e. a theoretical pluralism is required. 
- In addition, a key issue here is that it is a fundamentally empirical question as to which perspective is relevant and dominant in particular circumstances. 
- This empirically driven relevance opens up a significant, and open-ended, research agenda.

## Adam Smith Growth Model {.scrollable}

His theory stipulates that the increased division of labour in modern 
times largely accounts for increases in the production scale and overall workforce 
productivity (Meade, 2013).

Acemoglu (2012) argued that these ideas concerning the division of labour play an essential role in business expansion projects. In the context of the contemporary business environment, the division of labour comprises a profitable approach only if the company has access to an adequate market 
for its range of goods and services. -- conditional

Becker (2017) argued that the division of labour acts as a critical driver for accelerating investment 
and capital accumulation. Companies have recorded substantial increases in both 
production output and living standards; thus, society has experienced an increase in 
living standards. The author also argued that the importance of the division of labour 
is further enhanced in developed and industrialised nations. 

key drivers of economic growth and success. These include population growth, capital or 
investment growth, the division of labour concerning technological progress, and the 
application of appropriate modifications to the institutional framework of the 
economy in the form of free-market trading. By considering several variables, 
businesses and government agencies can achieve significant success by working 
collaboratively in the field of economic growth (Dopfer & Potts, 2015). 

## Harrod-Domar Model 

the Harrod-Domar model views capital rather than labour as the main driver of economic growth. In other words, this model takes an abundance of suitably qualified labour for granted, and consequently, capital 
becomes the bottleneck for economic growth. Therefore, increases in both the quantity 
and quality of available capital can lead to economic growth. 

## Keynesian Growth Model {.smaller}

In the labour- and capital-based growth theories above, economic growth is 
constrained by the quantity and quality of available resources.

a lack of demand for production output may be a key factor limiting economic growth. In such situations, increases in spending by both the government and consumers may be required for economic growth. 

He identified four key components of the output of economic goods and services (i.e. investment, consumption, government purchases, and net exports) and asserted that economic growth would result if an 
increase in demand could be achieved for any of them.

## Neoclassical Model and Solow growth model {.smaller}

The focus of this model is on capital accumulation as a primary 
element of economic development. The model highlights capital and labour as the two 
key drivers of production output but also takes into account other factors, such as 
technological progress.

## Endogenous Growth Model

McCombie and Thirlwall (2016) stated that this model is based on the assumption that the long-term economic growth of a country is determined primarily by endogenous variables (i.e. internal elements of the organisational system, such as human capital, innovation, and investment capital). 
Such variables as technological progress and scientific advancement, however, are 
considered dependent economic forces.

## Fuzzy set

- Missing in both views is recognition of the importance of the analysis of set relations in social research. Consider that almost all social science theory is verbal and, as such, is formulated in terms of sets and set relations.
- Researchers in the social sciences have long observed that although human beings break up their world into categories, they often use categories with blurred edges and gradations of membership. This is also true of many concepts employed in the social sciences themselves.

## A matter of degree

- If firm growth is thought to be a matter of degree, then fuzzy set theory claims that we can 
still meaningfully address the issue of how much the sets of firm that grow and financially constrained intersect. 

## Objectives

This thesis examines the firm growth and the conditions that may promote or mitigate the configuration, three countries in 2023.

## Ini belum

- Firms are heterogeneous on a large number of key dimensions, resources and capabilities.
- Firms operate in diverse environment.
- Different propensity to grow: majority do not grow, a small number enjoy very high growth rates, and many are not even interested in pursuing growth (@albulescuNonlinearRelationshipFirm2021; @coadScaleUpsHighGrowthFirms2024; @storeyUnderstandingSmallBusiness2016; @wiklundWhatTheyThink2003).

## Complexity {.smaller}

- Firms can operate in different condition and grow or they can operate in the same condition but do not grow. 
  + @coadFirmGrowthBarriers2012 found that some small firms are able to convert know-how into commercial success, while many others are unable to translate it into superior growth. 
  + @guerzoniWasRobertGibrat2024 found that small firms do not necessarily grow faster than their larger counterparts, depend on sector specific industry. 
  + Rapid growth firms are not concentrated in specific industries: labor or knowledge intensive industries; in manufacturing or service sector (@smallboneCharacteristicsStrategiesHigh1995; @storeyUnderstandingSmallBusiness2016). 
  + Idiosyncratic component even within industries: industries containing many fast-growing firms also contain a large number of firms experiencing rapid decline (@headdSmallBusinessGrowth2007).

## Configurational {.scrollable}

- @moreno-menendezHowFamilyBusinesses2021; @luSystemDynamicsModelling2023; @sahitiGrowthFirmsLessDeveloped2019 have started the idea that the unique configurations of external condition, resources and capabilities of firms are responsible for how much firms grow. 
- @sahitiGrowthFirmsLessDeveloped2019 revealed that firm growth cannot be assigned to one or other of these categories, but it is the interaction among macro and micro issues that counts. 
- We take up this idea that the prevailing way for firm to grow is the outcome of the configuration of sets of conditions.

## Research Agenda {.scrollable}

- To explore the degree to which firm heterogeneity (internal factors) and business environment (external factors) explain firm growth variability. 
- To explore configurations of factors suspected to causally influence firm growth.
- Little is known about how configurations among internal and external that foster or hinder growth.

## Propositions {.smaller}

- **Proposition 1**: Management practice condition is an influential element in firm growth.
- **Proposition 2**: Innovation and technology condition is an influential element in firm growth.
- **Proposition 3**: Workforce condition is an influential elements in firm growth.
- **Proposition 4**: Credit constraint condition is an influential element in firm growth.

## QCA {.scrollable}

- A phenomenon is studied as a combination of conditions that together produce an outcome.
- The effect of a particular condition on outcome is never fixed, as it depends on the other condition that co-occur at that point in time.
- The aim is to specify the causal recipe that is sufficient to explain the outcome of each case in a multiple case study.
- The causal recipes can then be compared across cases in order to identify similarity and differences.

## QCA {.scrollable}

- Heterogeneous causality: several different, but similar cases are selected and compared by comparing their heterogeneity (social complexity) and to the outcome  (occurrence/non-occurrence),
- Conditions are examined at the cross case level in term of union (disjunctions) and intersection (conjunctions)
- The goal is to find out which disjunctions (logical *or*) or conjunctions (logical *and*) consistently show (or not) a relation to the outcome.
