## Background {.scrollable}

Economists and policymakers are interested in studying the potential determinants of economic growth.

<br/>

<p style="text-align: center">--- the importance of economic growth for general human well-being ---</p>

## Motivation

To broaden the understanding of the determinants of firm growth. 

<br/>

Firm growth and decline is at the core of economic dynamics, provides ["opportunity"]{style="color:green;"}, ["prosperity"]{style="color:green;"} ... employment and contribution to GDP ... or ["disaster"]{style="color:red;"}.

## Southeast Asia - the globe’s richest biologically {.scrollable}

- Some countries have achieved enormous growth rates due to firm growth. 
- The COGAD has identified five characteristics common to these 13 high-growth economies, including one factor thought to be especially crucial: a high rate of savings and investment (Spence, 2008) --- ini ke perusahaan.
- The second circumstance inspiring this thesis is that the evidence remains inconclusive, as 
confirmed by an in-depth review of the existing empirical literature, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.
- Given the evident lack of consensus in the existing literature, it is imperative to 
summarise this conflict...quote some studies.

## Thus

- From the results of this empirical literature, the influence of various factors on firm growth varies from one country to another...thus configurational.

- Three key factors have been studied extensively for their potential influence on firm growth.

## Research agenda

Despite the difficulty imagining a modern economy without firm, the results of the current literature on the firm growth still vary between countries, which makes this field intriguing. 

<br />

This variation of results prompts several questions about the conditions behind this and, most importantly, investigate the potential ["causes"]{style="color:blue;"} of firm growth.



## Previous empirical works

With the availability of representative and comprehensive data sets --- much work has been done.

- Regressions: 
  + The growth rate of a firm as *dependent variable*, 
  + Attempts were made to explain this rate in terms of a long list of other variables.

## Results

Confirmed:

  + The heterogeneity of firm
  + Firm growth is highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict
  
- Discovered empirical regularities: the growth rate distributions follow a "tent-shaped" pattern.

## Neoclassical economics {.smaller}

Neo-classical economics provides a framework for understanding firm growth and its determinants, focusing on several key principles:

- Profit Maximization: ($MR$) = ($MC$) rule.

- Diminishing Returns: the additional output produced from each additional unit of input will eventually decrease.

- Flexible Prices and Wages: Prices and wages are adjusting to changes in supply and demand to maintain equilibrium in the market.

- Competitive Markets: Firms operating in an environment close to perfect competition, where prices are determined by competitive pressures.

## Determinants of Firm Growth {.smaller}

- Capital Accumulation: Investment in physical capital, such as machinery and equipment, is a key driver of firm growth. Firms grow by increasing their capital stock, which enhances their production capacity.

- Technological Progress: Technological advancements play a crucial role in firm growth by improving productivity and efficiency. Firms that adopt new technologies can produce more output with the same amount of inputs.

- Labor: The quantity and quality of labor employed by firms are important determinants of growth. Firms grow by hiring more workers or by improving the skills and productivity of their existing workforce.

- Market Conditions: The overall market environment, including demand for products and services, competition, and regulatory factors, influences firm growth. Firms that operate in favorable market conditions are more likely to grow.

- Managerial Efficiency: Effective management and organizational practices contribute to firm growth by optimizing resource allocation and improving decision-making processes.

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC) {.smaller}

![](images/ppf.png)

- Growth requires increases in quantity and quality of input (K and L).
- Growth requires conditions and specific types of resources and capabilities (firms are heterogeneous).
- Firm growth requires flexibility to make changes in technology, workforce composition, product, location.

## Criticisms of Neo-Classical Theory {.smaller}

While neo-classical economics provides a useful framework for understanding firm growth, it has been criticized.

- *The black-box* firm of equilibrium price theory with the famous MR=MC rule. 
- MC is derived from production and cost function
- MR is derived from demand function
- In the neo-classical scheme, what inhibits further production expansion are the increasing costs resulting from increasing the production. 
- Many managers report that in the real economy the black box is not controlled by the force of MC = MR, but by something more fundamental. Apparently it is not solely the marginal cost that makes firms to go into the standby position. 
- Real firms: enact strategies, manage the creation and acquisition of information and knowledge, and that have internal organisational structures and processes.

## Neoclassical economics +

- Transaction cost economics (TCE)
- Resource base view (RBV)
- Evolutionary Economics

## What is a firm?

[**A techno-functional entity**]{style="color:blue;"}

As a black box that transforms factor inputs into outputs---how production and cost functions interact with demand on the market, i.e. the emphasis is on technical matters and how firms function in the context of the market.

[**An institutional entity**]{style="color:blue;"}

Identity, internal structure and external boundaries (Hodgson, 2002)

## Quantity, quality and flexibility (K&L)

- The quantity and quality of $K$ and $L$ is derived from $MRP_L$ and $MRP_K$ ... a techno-functional entity.
- The flexibility in using $K$ and $L$ ... identity, internal structure and external boundaries...an institutional entity.

## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.smaller}

If we were to point out the strongest factors determining the obstacles, there would be three interrelated ones: (1) uncertainty, (2) competition and (3) lack of path dependence in the accumulation of capital. 

- Uncertainty determines the inevitability of making mistakes in every action undertaken.

- Competition means that there are always other entrepreneurs in markets who, in the environment of uncertainty, will succeed and fail at the same time as others do, interchangeably. 

- And finally, the third decisive factor: there is no guarantee that past successes improve the decision-making of firms in subsequent rounds.

## The message

- A central message presented in this research is that in discussing firm growth requires **both** techno-functional and institutional foundations.
- A firm as a techno-functional entity implies an ability to hire, buy and organise factors of production and contract for the sale of output. 
- This hiring, buying, organising and contracting implies a pre-existing institutional structure covering, for instance, legal and accounting systems. 
- Firm growth is a matter of degree/gradation

## The message

- No universal status can be claimed for any particular theoretical perspective, i.e. a theoretical pluralism is required. 
- A key issue here is that it is a fundamentally empirical question as to which perspective is relevant and dominant in particular conditions and circumstances. 
- This empirically driven relevance opens up a significant, and open-ended, research agenda.

## Growth as a matter of degree

- Firm growth can be seen as gradations of membership: stagnant, slow, fast, very fast.
- If firm growth is thought to be a matter of degree, then fuzzy set theory claims that we can 
meaningfully address the issue of how much the sets of firm that grow and conditions (such as financially constrained, size or age of firm) intersect. 

## Fuzzy set

- Consider that almost all social science theory is verbal and, as such, is formulated in terms of sets and set relations.
- Researchers in the social sciences have long observed that although human beings break up their world into categories, they often use categories with blurred edges and gradations of membership. 
- This is also true of many concepts employed in the social sciences such poverty, standard of living, financial development, economic growth and firm growth.

## QCA {.scrollable}

- A phenomenon is studied as a combination of conditions that together produce an outcome.
- The effect of a particular condition on outcome is never fixed, as it depends on the other condition that co-occur at that point in time.
- The aim is to specify the causal recipe that is sufficient to explain the outcome of each case in a multiple case study.

## Objectives

This thesis examines the configuration of conditions that may promote or mitigate firm growth. Firms can operate in different condition and grow or they can operate in the same condition but do not grow. 

<br/>

<p style="text-align: center">We take up the idea that the prevailing way for firm to grow is the outcome of the configuration of sets of conditions</p>.

## Research Agenda {.scrollable}

- To explore the degree to which firm heterogeneity (internal factors) and business environment (external factors) explain firm growth variability. 
- To explore configurations of factors suspected to causally influence firm growth.
- Little is known about how configurations among internal and external that foster or hinder growth.

## Empirical works

- **Internal**: age, profit, productivity, investment, competition, owner, ownership structure, legal status, capital intensity, management structure.
- **External**: an unsympathetic banking community, constricting government policies, tax and regulation, infrastructure, failures of business education.

## Contribution {.scrollable}

This study provides insights into new ways of conceptualizing firms’ improvements in terms of making business environment right by implementing a “right-factors configuration,” a map of combinations of conditions.

## Aims

The key objective of this thesis is to provide a deeper understanding of the configurations of conditions for firm growth.

In particular, this research aims to answer the following three research questions: 

- Does a correlation exist between a more robust financial sector and stable long-term economic growth? 

translate into equifinality, asymmetry, etc

## Benefits/contribution

Adding further empirical evidence to this nexus is quite essential; however, examining the factors that may erode or promote this relationship is more imperative. 

Discussing such factors justifies why the results vary between countries and assists policymakers in addressing issues that might erode this substantial influence before conducting national development plans to promote the financial sector. 

## Contribution

This thesis builds on the literature by creating and refining a broad and up-to-date new database based on the availability of relevant data to assess the relationship between financial development and economic growth and adds further evidence regarding financial development effects on economic growth.

## Limitation

Like most literature, limitations in data availability exist for some variables, such as the financial sector depth and informal institution dataset. 

Despite these concerns, this thesis created and refined a broad and up-to-date new database based 
on the availability of relevant data.
