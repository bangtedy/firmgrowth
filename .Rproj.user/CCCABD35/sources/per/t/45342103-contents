## Background {.scrollable}

Economists and policymakers are interested in studying the potential determinants of economic growth. Firm growth and decline is at the core of economic dynamics, provides ["opportunity"]{style="color:green;"}, ["prosperity"]{style="color:green;"} ... employment, output and reducing poverty ... or ["disaster"]{style="color:red;"}.

<p style="text-align: center">--- the importance of economic growth for general human well-being ---</p>

## Motivation

<p style="text-align: center">To broaden the understanding of the determinants of firm growth...[recipes!]{style="color:red;"}</p>

<br/>

## Southeast Asia {.scrollable}

- Growth—and the drivers behind that growth—vary by economy and subregion.
- The industrial landscape is dominated by small firms, which account for the bulk of output and employment
- Significantly less productive and account for a smaller share of the productivity growth... aggregate productivity in these economies remains low.
- Providing employment for a large proportion of less experienced and less educated workers belonging to the poorer households in urban and semi-urban areas. 
- The determinants of small firm performance in developing countries remain less understood, with much of the earlier literature focusing on the large firms. 

## The literature {.scrollable}

The evidence remains inconclusive!!

- Large firms, studies highlight factors like trade costs, lower Research and Development (R&D) spending and macro factors such as taxation and regulation.
- Existing studies on small firms in developing countries, stress firm capabilities, access to external finance, favorable location and geographical factors and robust social and physical infrastructure. 
- There are also studies which suggest that the development of the financial sector need not always be a pre-requisite for firm growth.

## Thus...configural?

Given the evident lack of consensus in the existing literature, it is imperative to summarise this conflict as ...

<br />

[the influence of various factors on firm growth varies from one country to another...conditional and configural?]{style="color:green;"}

## Research agenda

Despite the difficulty imagining a modern economy without firm, the results of the current literature on the firm growth still vary between countries, which makes this field intriguing. 

<br />

This variation of results prompts several questions about the conditions behind this and, most importantly, investigate the potential ["conditions"]{style="color:red;"} that cause firm growth.

## Neoclassical economics {.scrollable}

Neo-classical economics provides a framework for understanding firm growth and its determinants: 

- **Profit Maximization**: **MR = MC** rule.
- **Diminishing Returns**: the additional output produced from each additional unit of input will eventually decrease.
- **Flexible Prices and Wages**: Prices and wages are adjusting to changes in supply and demand to maintain equilibrium in the market.
- **Competitive Markets**: Firms operating in an environment close to perfect competition, where prices are determined by competitive pressures.

## Determinants of firm growth {.scrollable}

- **Capital Accumulation**: Investment in physical capital, such as machinery and equipment enhances their production capacity.
- **Technological Progress**: Technological advancements improve productivity and efficiency...so that firms that adopt new technologies can produce more output with the same amount of inputs.
- **Labor**: The quantity and quality of labor...firms grow by hiring more workers or by improving the skills and productivity of their existing workforce.
- **Market Conditions**: The overall market environment: demand for products and services, competition, and regulatory factors... firms that operate in favorable market conditions are more likely to grow.
- **Managerial Efficiency**: Effective management and organizational practices ... optimize resource allocation and improving decision-making processes.

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC) {.smaller}

![](images/ppf.png)

- Growth requires increases in quantity and quality of input (K and L).
- Growth requires conditions and specific types of resources and capabilities (firms are heterogeneous).
- Firm growth requires flexibility to make changes in technology, workforce composition, product, location.

## Criticisms of Neo-Classical Theory {.scrollable}

While neo-classical economics provides a useful framework for understanding firm growth, it has been criticized.

- The **black-box** firm of equilibrium price theory with the famous MR=MC rule. 
- In the Neo-classical scheme, what inhibits further production expansion are the increasing costs resulting from increasing the production. 
- Many managers report that in the real economy the black box is not controlled by the force of MC = MR, but by something more fundamental. Apparently it is not solely the marginal cost that makes firms to go into the standby position. 
- Real firms: enact strategies, manage the creation and acquisition of information and knowledge, and have internal organisational structures and processes.

## Neoclassical economics +

- Transaction cost economics (TCE)
- Resource base view (RBV)
- Evolutionary Economics

## What is a firm?

[**A techno-functional entity**]{style="color:blue;"}

As a black box that transforms factor inputs into outputs---how production and cost functions interact with demand on the market, i.e. the emphasis is on technical matters and how firms function in the context of the market.

[**An institutional entity**]{style="color:blue;"}

Identity, internal structure and external boundaries (Hodgson, 2002)

## Quantity, quality and flexibility (K&L)

- The quantity and quality of K and L is derived from $MRP_L$ and $MRP_K$ ... a techno-functional entity.
- The flexibility in using K and L ... identity, internal structure and external boundaries...an institutional entity.

## Empirical barriers to business expansion {.smaller}

If we were to point out the strongest factors determining the obstacles, there would be three interrelated ones: (1) uncertainty, (2) competition and (3) lack of path dependence in the accumulation of capital. 

- Uncertainty determines the inevitability of making mistakes in every action undertaken.

- Competition means that there are always other entrepreneurs in markets who, in the environment of uncertainty, will succeed and fail at the same time as others do, interchangeably. 

- And finally, the third decisive factor: there is no guarantee that past successes improve the decision-making of firms in subsequent rounds.

## The message

- A central message presented in this research is that in discussing firm growth requires [both]{style="color:red;"} techno-functional and institutional foundations.
- A firm as a techno-functional entity implies an ability to hire, buy and organise factors of production and contract for the sale of output. 
- This hiring, buying, organising and contracting implies a pre-existing institutional structure covering, for instance, legal and accounting systems. 

## The message

- No universal status can be claimed for any particular theoretical perspective, i.e. a theoretical [pluralism]{style="color:green;"} is required. 
- A key issue here is that it is a fundamentally empirical question as to which perspective is relevant and dominant in particular conditions and circumstances. 
- This empirically driven relevance opens up a significant, and open-ended, research agenda.

## Growth as a matter of degree

- Firm growth can be seen as [gradations]{style="color:red;"} of membership: stagnant, slow, fast, very fast.
- If firm growth is thought to be [a matter of degree]{style="color:red;"}, then fuzzy set theory claims that we can meaningfully address the issue of how much the sets of firm that grow and its conditions [(such as financially constrained, partly constrained, size, age of firm)]{style="color:green;"} intersect. 

## Fuzzy set

- Consider that almost all social science theory is verbal and, as such, is formulated in terms of sets and set relations.
- Researchers in the social sciences have long observed that although we break up things into categories, we often use categories with blurred edges and gradations of membership. 
- This is also true of many concepts employed in economics such as poverty, standard of living, financial inclusion, economic growth and firm growth.

## QCA (Qualitative Comparative Analysis)

- A phenomenon is studied as a combination of conditions that together produce an outcome.
- The effect of a particular condition on outcome is never fixed, as it depends on the other condition that co-occur at that point in time.
- The aim is to specify the causal [recipe]{style="color:red;"} that is sufficient to explain the outcome using Boolean logic.

## From QCA perspective

There are configurations of conditions that may promote or mitigate firm growth. Firms can operate in different condition and grow or they can operate in the same condition but do not grow. 

<br/>

<p style="text-align: center">The prevailing way for firm to grow is the outcome of the configuration of sets of conditions</p>

## Previous empirical works

Much work has been done using representative and comprehensive data sets.

- The growth rate of a firm as *dependent variable*, 
- Attempts were made to explain this rate in terms of a long list of other variables.
- Firm growth is highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict
- The growth rate distributions follow a "tent-shaped" pattern.

## Previous empirical works

- **Internal**: age, profit, productivity, investment, competition, owner, ownership structure, legal status, capital intensity, management structure.
- **External**: an unsympathetic banking community, constricting government policies, tax and regulation, infrastructure, failures of business education.

## Contribution {.scrollable}

This study provides recipes of a “right-factors configuration” ... conducive for firms’ improvements by making business environment right. 

<br />

Discussing such factors justifies why the results vary between countries and assists policymakers in addressing issues that might erode this substantial influence before conducting national development plans to promote private sector. 

## Limitation

Like most literature, limitations in data availability exist for some variables, such as  

Cross-section data

Longitudinal data
