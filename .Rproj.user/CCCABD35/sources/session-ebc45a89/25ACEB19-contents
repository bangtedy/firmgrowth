## Background {.scrollable}

- Southeast Asia - the globe’s richest biologically
- How to achieve increases in standards of living
- Without overly fixated to economic growth (or GDP!!), growth is crucial for becoming affluent.
- Firms provide “prosperity” and “opportunity” if they are able to grow.

## Firm growth 

![](images/ppf.png){width=80% fig-align="left"}

- Heuristic - PPC: quantity and quality of input
- Flexibility for firms to make changes in technology, workforce size and composition, product, location.
- Complex process: requires conditions and specific types of resources and capabilities

## Complex process

- Firms are heterogeneous on a large number of key dimensions, resources and capabilities.
- Firms operate in diverse environment.
- Different propensity to grow: majority do not grow, a small number enjoy very high growth rates, and many are not even interested in pursuing growth (@albulescuNonlinearRelationshipFirm2021; @coadScaleUpsHighGrowthFirms2024; @storeyUnderstandingSmallBusiness2016; @wiklundWhatTheyThink2003).

## Complexity {.smaller}

- Firms can operate in different condition and grow or they can operate in the same condition but do not grow. 
  + @coadFirmGrowthBarriers2012 found that some small firms are able to convert know-how into commercial success, while many others are unable to translate it into superior growth. 
  + @guerzoniWasRobertGibrat2024 found that small firms do not necessarily grow faster than their larger counterparts, depend on sector specific industry. 
  + Rapid growth firms are not concentrated in specific industries: labor or knowledge intensive industries; in manufacturing or service sector (@smallboneCharacteristicsStrategiesHigh1995; @storeyUnderstandingSmallBusiness2016). 
  + Idiosyncratic component even within industries: industries containing many fast-growing firms also contain a large number of firms experiencing rapid decline (@headdSmallBusinessGrowth2007).

## Configurational {.scrollable}

- @moreno-menendezHowFamilyBusinesses2021; @luSystemDynamicsModelling2023; @sahitiGrowthFirmsLessDeveloped2019 have started the idea that the unique conﬁgurations of external condition, resources and capabilities of firms are responsible for how much firms grow. 
- @sahitiGrowthFirmsLessDeveloped2019 revealed that firm growth cannot be assigned to one or other of these categories, but it is the interaction among macro and micro issues that counts. 
- We take up this idea that the prevailing way for firm to grow is the outcome of the configuration of sets of conditions.

## Research Agenda {.scrollable}

- To explore the degree to which firm heterogeneity (internal factors) and business environment (external factors) explain firm growth variability. 
- To explore configurations of factors suspected to causally influence firm growth.
- Little is known about how configurations among internal and external that foster or hinder growth.

## Empirical works

- **Internal**: age, profit, productivity, investment, competition, owner, ownership structure, legal status, capital intensity, management structure; not being able to explain more than a fraction of the variance in firm growth rates.
- **External**: an unsympathetic banking community, constricting government policies, tax and regulation, infrastructure, failures of business education. 
- Luck and random theories ... challenging innovation persistence theories (@bottazziExplainingDistributionFirm2006; @guarascioPersistenceInnovationPatterns2019)

## Conceptual Framework

```{r conceptual-frame, echo=FALSE, out.width="91%", fig.align='center', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/configur.png")
```

## Propositions {.smaller}

- **Proposition 1**: Management practice condition is an influential element in firm growth.
- **Proposition 2**: Innovation and technology condition is an influential element in firm growth.
- **Proposition 3**: Workforce condition is an influential elements in firm growth.
- **Proposition 4**: Credit constraint condition is an influential element in firm growth.
- **Proposition 5**: Regulation and taxes condition is an influential elements in firm growth.
- **Proposition 6**: Corruption condition is an influential element in firm growth.
- **Proposition 7**: Physical infrastructure condition is an influential element in firm growth.

## QCA {.scrollable}

- A phenomenon is studied as a combination of conditions that together produce an outcome.
- The effect of a particular condition on outcome is never fixed, as it depends on the other condition that co-occur at that point in time.
- The aim is to specify the causal recipe that is sufficient to explain the outcome of each case in a multiple case study.
- The causal recipes can then be compared across cases in order to identify similarity and differences.

## QCA {.scrollable}

- Heterogeneous causality: several different, but similar cases are selected and compared by comparing their heterogeneity (social complexity) and to the outcome  (occurrence/non-occurrence),
- Conditions are examined at the cross case level in term of union (disjunctions) and intersection (conjunctions)
- The goal is to find out which disjunctions (logical *or*) or conjunctions (logical *and*) consistently show (or not) a relation to the outcome.
