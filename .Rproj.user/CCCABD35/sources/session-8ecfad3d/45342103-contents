## Background {.scrollable}

Economists and policymakers are interested in studying the potential determinants of economic growth.

<p style="text-align: center">--- the importance of economic growth for general human well-being ---</p>



Firm growth and decline brings [prosperity, employment, output, reducing poverty]{style="color:green;"} ... or ["disaster"]{style="color:red;"}.



## Motivation

<br/>

<p style="text-align: center">To deepen the understanding of the determinants of firm growth!</p>

<br/>

## Southeast Asia {.scrollable}

- Growth and the drivers behind it vary by economy and subregion.
- The industrial landscape is dominated by small firms, which account for the bulk of output and employment
- Significantly less productive and account for a smaller share of the productivity growth... aggregate productivity in these economies remains low.
- Providing employment for a large proportion of less experienced and less educated workers belonging to the poorer households in urban and semi-urban areas. 
- The determinants of small firm performance in SeA countries remain less understood, with much of the earlier literature focusing on the large firms. 

## The literature {.scrollable}

The evidence remains [inconclusive!!]{style="color:red;"}

- For large firms: trade costs, lower Research and Development (R&D) spending and macro factors such as taxation and regulation.
- For small firms: firm capabilities, access to external finance, favorable location and geographical factors and robust social and physical infrastructure. 
- The development of the financial sector need not always be a pre-requisite for firm growth.

## Thus...contextual and configural?

The results of the current literature on the firm growth still vary between countries, which makes this field intriguing. 

<br />

This variation prompts several questions about the [context]{style="color:green;"} behind this phenomenon, most importantly, investigate the potential ["conditions"]{style="color:red;"} that cause firm growth.


## Research questions

1. Which configurations of conditions are associated with firm growth?
2. How do these configurations differ across contexts?

## Neo-classical economics

Neo-classical economics (NCE) framework for firm growth and its determinants: 

- **Profit Maximization**: **MR = MC** rule.
- **Diminishing Returns**: the additional output from each additional input will eventually decrease.
- **Flexible Prices and Wages**: Prices and wages are adjusting to changes in supply and demand to maintain equilibrium in the market.
- **Competitive Markets**: Firms operate in close to perfect competition, where prices are determined by competitive pressures.

## Determinants of firm growth {.scrollable}

- **Capital Accumulation**: Investment in physical capital, such as machinery and equipment enhances production capacity.
- **Labor**: The quantity and quality of labor--- grow by hiring more workers or by improving the skills and productivity of their existing workforce.
- **Managerial Efficiency**: Effective management and organizational practices --- optimize resource allocation and improve decision-making processes.
- **Technological Progress**: Technological advancements improve productivity and efficiency --- that firms that adopt new technologies can produce more output with the same amount of inputs.
- **Market Conditions**: The overall market environment: competition, and regulatory factors count --- firms that operate in favorable market conditions are more likely to grow.


## Production Possibility Curve {.smaller}

```{r ppc, echo=FALSE, out.width="71%", fig.align='left', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ppf.png")
```

- Growth requires increases in quantity and quality of input (**K** and **L**).
- Growth requires conditions and specific types of resources and capabilities.
- Firm growth requires [flexibility]{style="color:green;"} to make changes in technology, workforce composition, product, location.

## Criticisms of NCE {.scrollable}

While neo-classical economics provides a useful framework for understanding firm growth, it has been criticized.

- The **black-box** firm of equilibrium price theory with the famous MR=MC rule. 
- In the NCE, what inhibits further production expansion are the increasing costs resulting from increasing the production. 
- Many managers report that in the real economy the black box is not controlled by the force of MC = MR, but by something more fundamental. Apparently it is not solely the marginal cost that makes firms to go into the standby position. 
- Real firms: enact strategies, manage the creation and acquisition of information and knowledge, and have internal organisational structures and processes.

## NCE [+]{style="color:green;"}

```{r mrmc, echo=FALSE, out.width="71%", fig.align='left', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mrmc.png")
```

- Transaction cost economics (TCE)
- Resource base view (RBV)
- Evolutionary Economics

## What is a firm?

[**A techno-functional entity**]{style="color:green;"}

As a black box that transforms factor inputs into outputs---how production and cost functions interact with demand on the market, i.e. the emphasis is on technical matters and how firms function in the context of the market.

[**An institutional entity**]{style="color:green;"}

Identity, internal structure and external boundaries.

## Quantity, quality and flexibility

- The quantity and quality of K and L is derived from $MRP_L$ and $MRP_K$ --- a techno-functional entity.
- The flexibility in using K and L --- identity, internal structure and external boundaries --- an institutional entity.

## The three strongest obstacles {.smaller}

1. Uncertainty determines the inevitability of making mistakes in every action undertaken.

2. Competition: there are always other entrepreneurs in markets who, in the environment of uncertainty, will succeed and fail at the same time as others do, interchangeably. 

3. Lack of path dependence: there is no guarantee that past successes improve the decision-making of firms in subsequent rounds.

```{r potentialmr, echo=FALSE, out.width="71%", fig.align='left', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/potentialMR.png")
```

## The central message

In discussing firm growth requires [both]{style="color:red;"} techno-functional and institutional perspectives:

- A firm as a techno-functional entity implies an ability to hire, buy and organize factors of production and contract for the sale of output. 
- This hiring, buying, organizing and contracting implies a pre-existing institutional structure covering, for instance, legal and accounting systems. 

## The issue

A key issue here is that it is a fundamentally empirical question as to which perspective is relevant and dominant in particular conditions and context. 

<br />

This empirically driven relevance opens up a significant, and open-ended, research agenda.

## Fuzzy set

- Researchers in the social sciences have long observed that although we break up things into categories, we often use categories with blurred edges and gradations of membership. 
- This is also true of many concepts employed in economics such as poverty, standard of living, financial inclusion, economic growth and firm growth.

```{r standardofliv, echo=FALSE, out.width="71%", fig.align='right', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/standardofliving.png")
```
## Growth as a matter of degree

- Firm growth can be seen as [gradations]{style="color:red;"} of membership: stagnant, slow, fast, very fast.
- If firm growth is thought to be [a matter of degree]{style="color:red;"}, then fuzzy set theory claims that we can meaningfully address the issue of how much the sets of firm that grow and its conditions [(such as financially constrained, partly constrained, size, age of firm)]{style="color:green;"} intersect.

## Qualitative Comparative Analysis

- A phenomenon is studied as a combination of conditions that together produce an outcome.
- The effect of a particular condition on outcome is never fixed, as it depends on the other condition that co-occur at that point in time.
- The aim of QCA is to specify the causal [recipe]{style="color:red;"} that is sufficient to explain the outcome using set theory and Boolean algebra.

## Firm growth QCA perspective

<br />

There are configurations of conditions that are associated with firm growth. Firms can operate in different condition and grow or they can operate in the same condition but do not grow. 

<br />

The prevailing way for firm to grow is the outcome of the configuration of sets of conditions in certain context.

## Previous empirical works

Much work has been done using representative and comprehensive data sets: the growth rate of a firm as *dependent variable* and a long list of other variables.

- Firm growth is highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict.
- The growth rate distributions follow a "tent-shaped" or "cauchy" pattern.

```{r cauchy, echo=FALSE, out.width="25%", fig.align='right', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cauchy.png")
```

## Previous empirical works

<br/>

[Internal]{style="color:green;"}: age, profit, productivity, investment, competition, owner, ownership structure, legal status, capital intensity, management structure.

<br />

[External]{style="color:green;"}: an unsympathetic banking community, constricting government policies, tax and regulation, infrastructure, failures of business education.
